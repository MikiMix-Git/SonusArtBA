        "opis": "High-end low end. The subwoofer that matches seamlessly with your Dynaudio speakers… intelligently. Brand-new driver design, sophisticated DSP and full parametric EQ ensure a tailor-made fit for your set-up. The Sub 6 is designed to integrate seamlessly with all Dynaudio speakers – and it has a special trick up its sleeve to do just that… It features advanced intelligent DSP technology that tailors its performance so closely to a user’s system that it can confidently turn a two-way speaker system in a three-way one. For other models, including non-Dynaudio speakers, the crossover frequency, gain and phase can be set manually. In charge of its powerful bass response are two brand-new 24cm MSP+ Hybrid Drive units, designed specifically for subwoofers, alongside a 500W power amplifier built into its base. These new drivers sit at either end of the carefully constructed sealed enclosure design, which stands wider than it does deep to help it sit more discreetly against a wall. The Sub 6 has dual RCA and XLR connections to suit most systems and comes with a number of handy features to help larger and more advanced setups. This includes the ability to set a time-delay to ensure the sub and speakers are working perfectly in sync with one another. All a user has to do is enter the distance from the sub to the speakers and the sub will adjust itself automatically using both time and phase delays. There’s also a fully parametric EQ, including three filters to counter the effects of any room modes, to ensure the best possible performance. The Sub 6 comes in two finishes… • Black satin lacquer• White satin lacquer And its presets are designed to work with these speakers… The Sub 6 integrates so well into existing Dynaudio setups because our engineers decided to go over and above the call of duty to assess the acoustic characteristics of each of our popular high-end hi-fi speakers – and then create a custom performance map for each one. This information is built into the Sub 6 so, using its display and menu system, users can choose the specific model of selected Dynaudio speakers they have in their setup. The Sub 6’s roll-off will then be matched perfectly between the two, turning a two-way system into a three-way one. When we release new speakers, we'll release a firmware update for the Sub 6, adding their new performance maps so the Sub 6 can work just as closely with our latest models as it does with the classics. Subwoofers need a different balance from their drivers than stereo speakers. That’s why the Sub 6 uses Dynaudio’s new MSP+ Hybrid Drive units, which are made primarily from aluminium for stiffness, and specifically with subwoofers in mind. To counter ringing from the aluminium, it utilises a dual-action damping system that combines paper dampening on the back of the driver and Dynaudio’s own Magnesium Silicate Polymer material in a dampening cap on the front, ensuring the best performance.

        "opis": "Contour-level components and construction make the compact Sub 3, with its double-thickness front baffle and brand-new 24cm driver, the ideal companion for any stereo or multichannel system. The Sub 3 is a flexible subwoofer that’s been designed to work just as well with movies as it does with music, delivering weight, authority and punch no matter which source you use. It does all of this in a compact and convenient size, taking the strain of the low end away from any stereo or multi-channel setup and improving the midrange performance in the process. It has the same dimensions as the previous Dynaudio Sub 250, so it’s easy to accommodate, but our engineers have managed to squeeze in the more powerful 300W amp and full feature set of the larger Sub 600. There are some new additions too. There’s now a double-thickness 37mm front baffle (curved, similar to Contour) to increase its rigidity, plus a brand-new 24cm driver, which joins the rest of the Sub 3’s Contour-quality components. It’s been designed to this high standard for a reason – the Sub 3 can slot seamlessly into any system all the way up to this level, regardless of its size or configuration. Where there’s no subwoofer output on the amplifier (common in a stereo system setup) the Sub 3’s dual RCA inputs and outputs let you pass a signal through the Sub 3 itself. You can also fine-tune the crossover point (flat, 60Hz or 80Hz) using the Sub 3’s high-pass filter to ensure the best performance possible. We’ve worked really hard to get all the smarts of the Sub 600 into a body the size of the Sub 250, while also adding a brand-new driver. Most importantly, we’ve managed to get the price in between the two, which means users are now getting all the smarts of the Sub 600 – and then some – for €500 less than before.

The loudspeaker cable can be neatly concealed, running directly through the base plate into the channel in the rear section of the column, and re-appearing just underneath the top plate. The openings are wide enough to allow virtually all cable and connectors to go through. Loudspeakers may be positioned on the Stand 6 top plate using either the included soft damping stickers or the supplied spikes. The lower base plate is also fitted with spikes, which are adjustable in order to achieve a perfect foundation on un-level floors. Dedicated Stand 6 top adapter plates are available specifically for mounting the Dynaudio Confidence C1 and Contour S 1.4 loudspeaker models: With the available loudspeaker adapter pack, the C1 or S 1.4 base plinth fits perfectly onto the Stand 6. The Dynaudio Stand 6 is available in a choice of High-gloss Black, High-gloss White, Silver or Black finishes, allowing it to perfectly complement any loudspeaker and any room or décor.

        "opis": "Ultra-high performance loudspeaker. Launched in 1999, this gem represents a milestone in state-of-the-art loudspeaker technology and has set new standards in performance and product design. In a modular cabinet construction, a complement of Dynaudio’s most advanced driver designs comprised of four woofers, two midrange drivers and two soft dome tweeters are positioned in a vertically symmetric array. The highly-sophisticated crossover balances these ultra-high performance drivers by implementing DDC, reducing room reflections and delivering incredibly authentic and faithful music reproduction. The Evidence Master is comprised of three individual interlocking sections. The technically identical upper and lower cabinet sections house the bass drive units, while the middle section contains the midrange and treble drive units as well as the crossover, the latter being further isolated within its own individual sub-compartment. This construction offers a tremendous performance advantage, as each section can be optimized for the differing requirements of precise bass, midrange and high frequency reproduction.The middle section features a massive CNC-machined solid aluminum baffle which houses two special Dynaudio MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) cone midrange drivers and two perfectly matched and meticulously selected Dynaudio coated soft-dome tweeters. The elegant design of the aluminum baffle is a direct result of geometric optimization for absolutely perfect sound dispersion. The mechanical properties of aluminum, in conjunction with the mass of the middle section guarantee perfect resonance control – reproduction of high frequencies remains completely uncolored so even the finest musical details are precisely resolved.

        "opis": "Ultimate performance. Ultimate quality. Ultimate innovation. Meet the flagship of Dynaudio’s most advanced speaker range. Sometimes sizedoesmatter.  Confidence 60, the flagship of the Confidence family, towers above the outgoing Confidence C4 model. It’s unashamedly big; it’s unselfconscious hi-fi royalty. And it sounds like nothing else you’ve heard. Pull up a chair. While your ears are captivated by the Confidence 60’s astonishing power, scale and detail, your eyes will probably be drawn to the single Esotar3 28mm soft-dome tweeter in the middle. Then the twin 15cm MSP midrange drivers with Horizon Surrounds. And, finally to the two 23cm MSP NeoTec Woofers.  And they’re all part of the next generation of our innovative DDC (Dynaudio Directivity Control) sound-shaping technology platform. This focuses the sound waves radiating from the speakers into a tight vertical ‘beam’ that avoids reflections from floors and ceilings while maintaining a wide horizontal image. That means a bigger sweet-spot on the couch, a happier audience, and the knowledge that you’re only hearing what the drivers are producing – and not what the room itself is bringing to the party.(Something you can learn more about in our six-part podcast series on Confidence). The star of the show is the DDC Lens – a machined aluminium waveguide integrated into the precision Compex composite baffle. This ingenious part (the result of hundreds of hours of simulations, prototyping and listening tests) works in conjunction with the baffle shape, the tweeter and the midrange drivers (notice their  Horizon Surround, also part of the system) and the woofers to focus sound waves where they need to go: you. In fact, everything in the Confidence 60 is designed precisely for that purpose. Even the gasket that decouples the baffle from the cabinet, and the screws that hold everything in place. The Esotar3 28mm soft-dome tweeter takes over 40 years of Dynaudio expertise, plus plenty of learnings from development of the award-winning Esotar Forty unit – and rolls it all into the finest tweeter we’ve ever created. A powerful neodymium magnet system, innovations in airflow routing, the resonance-busting Hexis inner dome … it all combines to increase detail, clarity and sensitivity. The 23cm NeoTec MSP woofers also have neodymium magnets under the hood, and use three layers of glass-fibre in their voice-coil formers for optimum stiffness. The voice-coils themselves are copper (which provides extra moving mass for tighter, more powerful and more controlled bass in this specific driver design). And the entire woofer motor has been designed to harness airflow using an innovative venting system that’s been machined directly into the magnet. The Confidence 60’s MSP midrange drivers are a big departure from previous Dynaudio designs. They use a radical surround design – the Horizon – that follows the cone’s shape right to the edge of the driver. This reduces the surround’s first resonant mode to effectively increase the whole playing surface area and improve performance. They also sit flush with the baffle to reduce diffractions from the diaphragm and the adjacent tweeter. Behind the scenes, the basket has been given a lightweight organic design – one that’s resulted from extensive topology-optimisation simulations. It increases airflow, maintains its stability and rigidity and reduces weight simultaneously without sacrificing performance. And it’s all finished in our trademark Danish-designed furniture-grade cabinetry. Perfect performance, perfect quality. The legend continues. The all-new Esotar3 is optimised for detail, finesse and performance. It includes the ingenious Hexis resonance-defeating inner dome, plus innovations in materials, airflow and more. Dynaudio Directivity Control, our sound-shaping technology platform, has been rebooted, revamped and refined to include the DDC Lens –a unique machined waveguide that focuses your music exactly where it should go: your ears. We’ve taken our legendary MSP woofers to new heights. A combination of powerful neodymium magnets and aluminium and copper voice-coils mean each driver is individually engineered and tuned for one purpose: unsurpassed quality.

        "opis": "Listen with Confidence: add a source, hit the power, and get the performance your music deserves. Active hi-fi just had its biggest upgrade in over a decade. Confidence 20A is the most elegant way to build the simplest audiophile system. It takes the standard Confidence 20’s head-turning looks, legendary drivers and award-winning sound, and hides studio-grade amplifiers right inside its stands. Under the hood, it uses the same audio-processing tools you’ll find in our flagship Core professional reference speakers: think full DSP, analogue and digital connectivity, and pro-level room-compensation controls. Everything you need to hear. If you’re all about the audiophile chase, we have some news for you: you won. Confidence 20A is designed to require only two things of the listener: a source, and some faith. Why faith? Because it does away with one of the most cherished indulgent proclivities of the audiophile world: auditioning amplifiers. They’re already included. They’ve been specced, tuned, customised… and hidden away in the stands. For some that might well be a deal-breaker. And that’s OK; we offerplentyofother optionsfor wantonproclivity-indulgence. For those who want a simpler but no less fulfilling life, there’s Confidence 20A. We’re no strangers to high-end active hi-fi systems, of course (inventing the category does tend to leave a lasting memory or two). And that means we have years of experience: plenty of do-more-of-thats, never-do-that-agains, sugar-and-caffeine-fuelled breakthroughs – and hard-earned research and development – to dip into. So, when it was suggested that we try to make an active version of our flagship speaker, cake was duly ordered and the coffee machine set to maximum SPL (stimulation per litre). Our aim was to create the largest possible soundstage in a compact speaker; a system that can replace a large passive set-up. One that doesn’t just ask politely that you come to have a listen – it makes itself irresistible. An active speaker has an amplifier for each individual driver. Confidence 20A uses some of the best in the business. We’ve teamed up again with our friends at Pascal over in Copenhagen, who have provided reference-quality amplification for our Core professional studio speakers. Here, the Esotar 3 tweeters get a more-than-ample 150W, while the NeoTec mid/bass drivers get a whopping 400W each. (And here’s a fun fact: we limit the amp so it matches the driver’s maximum excursion – meaning there’s plenty of headroom, and you’ll never get it to distort. Even at neighbour-baiting volumes.) The controls are round the back, integrated into the custom aluminium stand… which also doubles as a heatsink for the amplifiers; helps to form part of the speaker’s downward-firing bass port;andadds weight for extra stability. Win, win, win. Curious about active speakers? Read more about their differences with passive speakershere. And while it might not be a smart speaker, it’s still clever. There are balanced analogue and AES3 digital XLR connections; settings for left/right placement; adjustable analogue sensitivity controls; sound-balance filters (‘Dark’, ‘Neutral’ and ‘Bright’ adjustments derived from our pro speakers); sample-rate conversion controls to preserve native resolution or enable true gapless playback; and native room-position settings (‘Wall’, ‘Corner’ and ‘Free’). You can even control the LED logo’s brightness. The drivers are the same precision units you’ll find in the passive Confidence 20, optimised for active. There’s the Esotar 3 tweeter, of course: our flagship high-frequency driver that made its debut in 2018 with the next-gen Confidence launch. It has a 28mm precision-coated soft-dome diaphragm, backed-up by the Hexis resonance-defeating inner dome. In the engine-room is an aluminium voice coil that minimises weight for improved transient response, plus a powerful neodymium magnet system for increased sensitivity and stellar dynamic range. There’s also a large damped metal back-chamber for lowering resonant frequencies and improving clarity. It's such a good tweeter, in fact, that it’s used in ourM-series main monitors– which take pride of place in some of the world’s most important recording studios. The 18cm NeoTec woofer also has a neodymium-based motor (which incorporates an ingenious venting system for optimised air movement). Its aluminium voice-coil is wedded to a glass-fibre voice-coil former for optimum stiffness, and it’s fronted by our signature precision MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) cone. And while it might seem a little bit peculiar to start waxing lyrical over holes, we trust you’ll indulge us if you’ve read this far. That’s because Confidence 20A has seen a leap forward in bass-port design. Yes, a bass-port is just a hole. But this anengineeredhole. AnExponentially Shaped Dual Flaredone. Confidence 20A’s ESDF port has an end-to-end exponential shape that almost totally eliminates noise. It means you get vastly improved bass performance – which, of course, influences everything else up the frequency range. Think more precision to vocals, more clarity to strings and (of course) more weight to the thumps and bumps. You might not be able to see it, but it’s been an incredibly focussed effort by our engineers – and one they’re rightly very proud of. Confidence 20A is the next generation of Dynaudio active speakers. Simplicity and precision… the hallmarks of any great audio system. EISA Award - Best Product 2025-2026 - Active loudspeakers. “The latest addition to Dynaudio’s flagship Confidence series becomes the brand’s premium active loudspeaker – and makes a stunning impression…the Confidence 20A’s beautifully judged sonics offer controlled bass, crystal-clear detail and thrilling dynamism… This is a high-end, gorgeously styled active speaker that delivers the sonic goods, but without the hassle that high-performance audio sometimes entails.” – EUROPEAN IMAGING AND SOUND ASSOCIATION, August 2025 \"This is a high-end, gorgeously styled active speaker that delivers the sonic goods, but without the hassle.\" \"Superbly balanced sound stage with an unusual degree of transparency and focus.\" \"An incredible loudspeaker system.

        "opis": "Next-generation DDC sound-beaming technology leads the way in the smallest of the Confidence floor-standers. The tricky thing about producing the best is that at some point you have to beat it. The good thing is that when you’re working with the team that created the original, the job becomes easier – and more fun. So, when the Confidence 30 three-way floor-stander rolled out of Dynaudio Labs in Skanderborg, there was much rejoicing. It tips an affectionate nod to Confidence models past while taking their innovations and their performance to the next level. Like the rest of the range, the Confidence 30 features the Esotar3 tweeter . This takes lessons learned during the development of the award-winning Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter – including optimised airflow technology, an improved neodymium magnet design and the ingenious Hexis resonance-busting inner dome – and takes things up a notch or three. Also on board are two updated 18cm NeoTec MSP woofers (which also feature powerful neodymium magnet systems and some intensely clever airflow tech); an ultra-stable, ultra-rigid Compex composite front baffle; an improved 15cm midrange driver with the airflow-correcting Horizon Surround ; a down-firing bass port … and the next generation of the DDC (Dynaudio Directivity Control) sound-beaming technology, including the brilliant DDC Lens around the tweeter. All the Confidence 30’s components (even the screws and gaskets that hold the baffle in place) work in perfect harmony as part of the DDC platform to vastly reduce floor and ceiling reflections while maintaining an accurate horizontal image. It means you can place the speakers in a larger space without needing room treatment, special rugs or ceilings or… well, anything. It just works.(Something you can learn more about in our six-part podcast series on Confidence). And it means you hear only what the artist intended. \"It separates wide and deep events well, and there are no complaints about the accuracy: everything is heard.\" \"In terms of transparency, resolution and fine dynamics, Confidence 30 takes a big step forward.\"  The new 28mm Esotar3 soft-dome tweeter takes over 40 years of Dynaudio expertise, plus plenty of new learnings from the award-winning Esotar Forty unit – and rolls it all into the finest tweeter we’ve ever created. A powerful neodymium magnet system, innovations in airflow routing, the new resonance-busting Hexis inner dome… it all combines to increase detail, clarity and sensitivity. Dynaudio Directivity Control, our sound-shaping technology platform, has been rebooted, revamped and refined to include the DDC Lens –a unique machined waveguide that focuses your music exactly where it should go: your ears. We’ve taken our legendary MSP woofers to new heights. A combination of powerful neodymium magnets and aluminium and copper voice-coils mean each driver is individually engineered and tuned for one purpose: unsurpassed quality. We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "We don’t think a speaker’s size should dictate how good it sounds… so we don’t let it. The compact Confidence 20 takes the performance, the passion and the power of the range’s larger speakers, and puts it on a stand. We’ve spent years looking at how we could improve on the previous range of Confidence speakers. And, after almost countless hours in design labs, our state-of-the-art Jupiter measuring facility, modeling and simulation suites – and, of course, listening rooms – we’ve done it. Like the rest of the range, the Confidence 20 features the 28mm Esotar3 soft-dome tweeter, plus an improved 18cm NeoTec MSP woofer and an innovative down-firing bass port. Its drivers feature cutting-edge developments in airflow technology (including a much larger rear chamber and optimised venting in the tweeter, plus the resonance-stabilising Hexis inner dome); simulation-derived diaphragm thickness; super-powerful neodymium magnets; and the Compex front baffle. The 28mm Esotar3 soft-dome tweeter takes over 40 years of Dynaudio expertise, plus plenty of learnings from the award-winning Esotar Forty unit – and rolls it all into the finest tweeter we’ve ever created. A powerful neodymium magnet system, innovations in airflow routing, the resonance-busting Hexis inner dome… it all combines to increase detail, clarity and sensitivity. The 18cm NeoTec MSP woofer also has neodymium under the hood, and uses glass-fibre in its voice-coil former for optimum stiffness.The voice-coil itself is aluminium, which lets us use the ideal weight (or lightness, depending on your point of view) for powerful and controlled bass as well as refined midrange. And the entire woofer motor has been designed to harness airflow using an innovative venting system that’s been machined directly into the magnet.(Something you can learn more about in our six-part podcast series on the Confidence). We’re guessing you want to know how it sounds… and the answer is, simply, “like your favourite artist”. Nothing more, nothing less. \"Sonically arresting and ultimately irresistible, making for an easy and enthusiastic recommendation.\" \"The quality with which these speakers deliver bass is utterly beyond. I don't think a single audiophile sat blindfolded in my listening room would ha... \"If you are on a quest for good speakers, I recommend that you take the Dynaudio Confidence 20 into serious consideration.\" The legend continues. The all-new Esotar3 is optimised for detail, finesse and performance. It includes the ingenious Hexis resonance-defeating inner dome, plus innovations in materials, airflow and more. We put Confidence through intensive – and exhaustive – testing in the Jupiter measuring facility at Dynaudio Labs.

        "opis": "With great power comes great responsibility. That’s why these large floorstanders are just as adept at shaking the room as they are reproducing the finest of details. The Confidence 50 stands shoulder-to-shoulder (or baffle-to-baffle) in height with the Confidence C4 – the previous flagship of the range. Like that legendary speaker, it’s a three-way design with twin woofers and twin midrange drivers. It’s stunningly constructed. Stunningly finished. And a stunning performer. It uses DDC (Dynaudio Directivity Control) technology to form a sound ‘beam’ that avoids reflections from floors and ceilings. And it features an Esotar tweeter and MSP woofers. But it takes all of this – every single component – to an elevated level of performance. You might notice that while the previous Confidence floor-standers used two tweeters, the updated Confidence 50 has just one. That’s because the engineers toiling away in Dynaudio Labs have discovered ways to optimise crossovers, waveguides and baffles to create a much simpler, better-performing version of the DDC platform(Peek behind the curtain and see how we decided to go with one tweeter instead of two in our six-part podcast series on Confidence). It all centres on the DDC Lens – the stunning precision-machined waveguide around the Esotar3 tweeter (we think you’ll agree that’s a mouth-watering combination right there). The DDC Lens has been simulated and topology-optimised to vertically focus the tweeter, midrange drivers and woofers on the listening position. That results in dramatically reduced reflections from floors and ceilings – which means you hear exactly what the driver system, and not the room, is doing. The 28mm Esotar3 soft-dome tweeter takes over 40 years of Dynaudio expertise, plus plenty of learnings from the award-winning Esotar Forty unit – and rolls it all into the finest tweeter we’ve ever developed. A powerful neodymium magnet system, innovations in airflow routing, the resonance-busting Hexis inner dome … it all combines to increase detail, clarity and sensitivity. The Confidence 50’s updated MSP midrange drivers are a big departure from previous Dynaudio designs. They use a radical surround design – the Horizon – that follows the cone’s shape right to the edge of the driver. This reduces the surround’s first resonant mode to effectively increase the whole playing surface area and improve performance. They also sit flush with the baffle to reduce diffractions from the diaphragm and the adjacent tweeter. Behind the scenes, the basket has been given a lightweight organic design – one that’s come from extensive topology-optimisation simulations. It increases airflow, maintains its stability and rigidity and reduces weight simultaneously without sacrificing performance. Everything is held securely in place in the ultra-rigid, super-damped and acoustically inert Compex composite baffle. It echoes the design of previous Confidences – but brings the look up to date in aesthetics and acoustic principles. That’s because it forms an integral part of the DDC Lens system, as well as providing perfect coupling and decoupling of the drivers. Down below is the bass port . You won’t see it; it sits under the speaker. And because it fires downwards, we’ve been able to design it to perform exactly as we want it to without having to worry about putting a big hole in the beautiful finish. And, honestly, you have to hear it to believe it… \"All the ingredients of a quality speaker.\" \"Become one with the music .\" \"An astonishing level of resolution.\" The legend continues. The all-new Esotar3 is optimised for detail, finesse and performance. It includes the ingenious Hexis resonance-defeating inner dome, plus innovations in materials, airflow and more. Dynaudio Directivity Control, our sound-shaping technology platform, has been rebooted, revamped and refined to include the DDC Lens –a unique machined waveguide that focuses your music exactly where it should go: your ears. We’ve taken our legendary MSP woofers to new heights. A combination of powerful neodymium magnets and aluminium and copper voice-coils mean each driver is individually engineered and tuned for one purpose: unsurpassed quality.

        "opis": "You know what they say about good things and small packages… Our compact speakers have been raising eyebrows with their performance for more than 40 years. The smallest member of the Focus family will send them skyward once again. Focus 10 is more than just a pair of active loudspeakers. It’s a complete music system, packed from top to bottom with the technology that’s taken Dynaudio to legendary status – allied with the most cutting-edge wireless features we could think of. And we thought of a lot. Streaming is placed front and centre. With Spotify Connect, Tidal Connect, Apple AirPlay 2, Google Chromecast, Roon, Bluetooth and local network capabilities on board, Focus 10 can play literally anything stored in digital form, from anywhere you can access it – online or on a networked hard-drive at home. Hundreds of millions of tracks, all accessible at the touch of a finger on your phone or tablet. Thanks to their built-in WiSA technology, the speakers will also connect wirelessly to a compatible TV or USB dongle – doing away with the need for bulky home cinema electronics and freeing-up space on your equipment rack for something other than yet another black rectangle. And the beauty is, it’s all so simple. Minimal set-up time, only two cables for the wall-plugs and an elegant, intuitive app to customise, set presets and more. Going from unboxing to hearing true audiophile sound has never been this quick or easy. ‘Active’ doesn’t mean one single amplifier per speaker. It means one single amplifier perdriver. For Focus 10, that means two each. Why an amp for each individual tweeter and mid/bass unit? Because that gives us more control over their performance. And that means each driver sounds as good as it possibly can, with no compromise. It’s all kept in check with sophisticated DSP (digital signal processing) tech. We took all the lessons we learned while creating our award-winning Focus XD, Xeo, LYD and Core ranges and produced a system that’s as effective as it is simple to use. Tell the speakers where they are in your room (near a wall, in a corner or in free space) by choosing the appropriate option in the Dynaudio app, and they’ll optimise their performance for that position. If you want to delve deeper into calibration there’s optional Dirac Live technology for completely bespoke results. Even the magnetic grille is smart. Focus 10 has specific EQ settings for when it’s in use or not (you’ll know it’s doing its thing when you see the light glow blue briefly). There’s brawn to go with the brains, too. With a total of 390W of class-D Pascal amplification under the hood in each speaker (110W for the tweeter and 280W for the woofer), Focus 10 is primed and ready to fill even a midsize room with high-quality sound. In fact, we’d say they pack more punch than a speaker of their size has any right to. There’s even an automatic failsafe system to ensure the speakers aren’t damaged when cranked to neighbour-bothering levels: a bespoke sliding high-pass filter reduces woofer excursion as the volume rises. Clever. The drivers themselves are every bit as impressive as the technology that feeds them. Up top is a 28mm Cerotar soft-dome tweeter. It uses techniques and materials developed during the creation of our acclaimed Confidence, Special Forty and Core ranges – including the Hexis inner dome (which sits just under the diaphragm and refines airflow behind the playing surface to smooth the frequency response and reduce unwanted resonances). The optimised magnet system uses a strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic design to increase tweeter sensitivity – which brings incredible detail and a sweet, natural treble response. That means an extremely low level of listener fatigue… which means you can listen for longer. Always a good thing. The 14cm Esotec+ mid/bass driver is the best we’ve ever created in this size chassis. We created it using experience gained while developing the new Contour series – so to say it has pedigree is something of an understatement. Its new surround and improved magnet system create an extended throw length, which extends the frequency response at lower frequencies while hanging on to its stellar midrange performance. And because the box is closed, we’ve been able to extend that low-frequency performance down to trouser-flapping depths. Focus 10 wouldn’t be a Dynaudio speaker if it didn’t look incredible. It’s available in four beautiful finishes – Blonde Wood, Walnut Wood, Black High Gloss and White High Gloss – each developed to complement real-world living spaces. After all, not everyone wants to re-arrange their living-room around their speakers. Then there are the little touches you might not notice at first. The brushed anodised aluminium cover rings on the tweeter and mid/bass driver. The discreet Dynaudio logo on the grille’s aluminium top. The light on the front of the speaker, which glows gently in different colours to tell you what’s happening. Even the backplate has been given special treatment. Focus 10 is true Danish high-end hi-fi, made wireless. If your raised eyebrows had eyebrows, they’d be raised as well.

        "opis": "Hi-fi quality with consumer convenience… the perfect combination Be bold… Listen alone. Listen with friends. Listen to old favourites or something surprisingly ‘not you’. Listen to music. Listen to your TV. Listen to your turntable and millions of hi-res online tracks. Listen without cables. Without having to leave your seat. Without limits. Focus 30 gives you access to everything that’s ever been recorded and put online. These compact floorstanding speakers are loaded with futureproof streaming technology and connectivity to bring a new world of audiophile-quality music directly to your living room. And when we say ‘loaded’, we mean it. With Spotify Connect, Tidal Connect, Apple AirPlay 2, Google Chromecast, Roon, Bluetooth and local network connectivity on board (and with the capability for even more), Focus 30 will accept streaming audio from any compatible device. That could be a laptop, a phone, a tablet, a network-attached storage device… even a smart watch. If your content is stored in hi-res, your ears are in for a real treat. And if you have a bunch of equipment from your previous system, you can keep using it. A full set of digital and analogue connections on the rear panel means you can use your CD player or turntable alongside Focus 30’s built-in streaming smarts. We’ve thought of TV owners, too. If you don’t want the bulk of a full AV receiver, equipment rack and cabling in your living room (maybe you’d like to have something a little more attractive under your TV – like a bookshelf, or your dog), Focus 30 has you covered. Its built-in WiSA technology connects wirelessly to a compatible TV or USB dongle to bring its audio seamlessly to your speakers. No clutter, no fuss. Focus 30 has more than 40 years of acoustic expertise to back-up its technological wizardry. Its drivers are classic Dynaudio: a Cerotar soft-dome tweeter with the ingenious resonance-defeating, frequency-smoothing, fatigue-busting Hexis device – plus twin 14cm MSP Esotec+ mid/bass units. What could be more familiar? The Cerotar tweeter is based on the range-topping Esotar 3 you’ll find in our Confidence range. It uses a strontium carbonate Ferrite+ magnet system, optimised for airflow, to increase sensitivity. In practice that means clear, sweet, detailed treble that’s easy to listen to… perfect for listening late into the night. The Esotec+ mid/bass units are made from MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer), a material we developed ourselves and have been refining and using for four decades. It provides exactly the right combination of lightness, stiffness and damping for incredible control over midrange and low frequencies. Couple that with a lightweight aluminium voice-coil (for more accuracy, control and finesse) and an improved magnet system that generates more driver excursion (for lower, punchier bass and more midrange clarity) and you’ve a formula for addictive, toe-tapping performance. And the closed-box cabinet design lets us take full advantage of the powerful amplification and DSP (digital signal processing) on board – marrying the extreme low-frequencies, the expressive midrange and soaring treble in exciting new ways. Focus 30 is active, which means each individual driver is powered by its own amplifier. There are three amps in each speaker – each one tailored to the driver it’s paired with. It means we can zero in on that particular driver’s strengths, bringing them out without needing to compromise for other frequencies. The tweeter has a 110W amp, and each mid/bass driver has its own 280W powerhouse. We’ve used high-quality class-D amps from our partners at Pascal in Copenhagen. We know each other well: our flagship pro speaker series, Core – used in some of the world’s top studios – also uses Pascal amps. We think you’ll agree that being able to draw a sonic line directly from the artist to your living room is something rather special. That line continues through the DSP. As with our pro speakers, you can tell Focus 30 where it’s sitting in your room (near a wall, in a corner or in free space) via a simple switch in the companion Dynaudio app and it will optimise itself to sound its best in that position. There’s even optional Dirac Live integration for a deep-dive into calibration – and completely customised results. The speakers even know when they’re wearing a magnetic grille or are standing in their birthday suit – and they’ll optimise themselves accordingly. And they’re constantly keeping an ear out for the kind of volume levels that could cause damage to the drivers and amp; a custom sliding high-pass filter rolls off the bass at high volume to keep everything balanced. In practice, that means you get deeper bass at lower volume levels – and you can push the speakers louder overall (your neighbours can thank you later). Some active systems look like weird creatures from the future… but who wants a couple of spiky novelties peering back at them in the living room? With Focus 30 we’ve stuck to what we do best: simple, stylish, timeless Danish design. We studied interior design trends and tailored the whole product family for real-life rooms and real people. You’ll get top-quality cabinetry, glorious fit-and-finish (check out the anodised brushed aluminium cover rings and discreet Dynaudio logo on the grille), and four furniture grade finishes (see below). Just as you’d expect from a high-end hi-fi system. Focus 30 isn’t just a pair of active speakers. It isn’t yet another copycat wireless system. It’s so much more – a true audiophile-grade game-changer. It’s time to listen to something new… \"The Focus 30 have many qualities to entice discerning music lovers who want above all to enjoy their favourite tunes.\" \"(...) these Danes can – despite their slight frame – produce almost anything and everything that the human hearing range could wish for.\" \"Perfect as a wireless speaker, with furnishing-friendly size and room correction that optimizes the sound for the room. We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ... If you're rocking a pair of Dynaudio speakers, then you should probably be rocking a Dynaudio Sub 6 too. Why? Well, as we explain on this episode of A...

        "opis": "Perhaps the world’s most advanced active wireless hi-fi system Focus 50 is the pinnacle of wireless hi-fi. All the convenience of a consumer speaker system with all the heavyweight credentials of our most prestigious hi-fi speakers. Focus 50 is an active wireless stereo speaker system brimming with connectivity. If you want to fill your room with true audiophile performance without also filling it with cables, boxes and racks, this one is for you. Connect over the air via Apple AirPlay 2 from your MacBook, iPad or iPhone; with Google Chromecast from your Android phone, tablet or Chromebook; using Spotify Connect or Tidal Connect from… well, anything with Spotify or Tidal on it. Hook up with Roon; stream via Bluetooth. You can even connect your physical digital sources via coaxial or optical digital inputs, your analogue ones (including turntables, 8-track machines and Edison Concert Phonographs) via line-in or a compatible adaptor, and your networked devices via Ethernet or Wi-Fi. What does that mean? Effectively, that if it’s been released as a recording, you can listen to it. All of it. And hi-res heaven is only a smartphone swipe away. Focus 50 is designed for living rooms, not sterile listening caves. It’s built for those who want to share amazing sound with their loved ones (invite them over and get them connected… but good luck getting them to leave again). That’s why we’ve also built-in WiSA streaming. Focus 50 can connect wirelessly to your TV (and therefore anything else connected to it) and take the place of a hulking AV receiver/cable tangle/equipment stand combination. The only downside? Your cat won’t be able to warm itself on the amp any more… We’d be amazed if it took you longer than five minutes to go from unboxing to listening. Just plug the speakers into the mains, launch the accompanying Dynaudio app, follow the guided set-up instructions (which gets you connected to your network and helps you optimise your speakers), and that’s it. Focus 50 only needs two cables: one for each power plug. That’s because its amplifiers are built in. And not just one amplifier per speaker either – each individual driver has its own amp, specifically tuned and optimised to work with that exact unit. No compromising with one-size-fits-nothing amplification, no hassle with component matching, no cables gathering dust. It’s a tailored system. Each speaker has three class-D amplifiers on board: one 110W unit for the Cerotar tweeter, a 280W amp for the neodymium midrange driver, and one 280W amp for the twin Esotec+ bass drivers (which are driven in parallel). They all come from our partners at Pascal in Copenhagen – the same company we’ve worked with to create the power plants for our mighty Core professional studio systems. Peak power, you ask? A whopping 1000W. The Focus 50s – and your ears – are in good hands. All that power is marshalled by sophisticated DSP (digital signal processing) technology – the same type we use in our Core and LYD pro ranges. During set-up in the app, tell the speakers where they are in the room (near a wall, in a corner or in free space) and they’ll optimise their performance for that position. And if you (or an installer) want to take calibration to the next level, there’s optional Dirac Live tech for total customisation. We’ve even included custom EQ presets that take into account whether or not the magnetic grille is installed… and you don’t have to do anything to activate them (besides installing said grille, of course). Auto-sensing technology in the speaker understands when the grille is on or off – and the ‘Y’-shaped light briefly glows blue to let you know that it knows. Ingenious. And to prevent speaker damage at high volumes, we’ve designed a custom sliding high-pass filter that reduces woofer excursion as the level goes up. (Although your neighbours will probably be banging on the wall long before that happens.) We’re always excited to be able to use new flagship hardware across our range. Focus 50 draws heavily from techniques and technologies used in our high-end Contour and Confidence passive hi-fi families. For example, the soft-dome Cerotar tweeter uses the Confidence’s Hexis inner dome. It’s a clever extra part that sits just behind the playing surface to optimise airflow and minimise unwanted resonances. Sitting behind it is a strontium carbonate Ferrite+ magnet system to maximise sensitivity. In English, that means sweeter, clearer treble, which is easier to listen to for much longer. Complementing the tweeter is a dedicated midrange driver (the only one in the Focus range), derived from the award-winning Contour 60. It’s a 15cm unit with a powerful neodymium magnet, a glass-fibre voice-coil former and a trademark Dynaudio aluminium voice-coil. This fleet-footed unit uses lightweight magnet and coil materials to give it more agility while maintaining a tight grip on midrange frequencies. And for you, that means Contour-level performance. Handling the bottom end is a pair of 18cm Esotec+ woofers. They use trickle-down tech from both Confidence and Contour to deliver tight, powerful bass. Unlike other Focus models, however, there’s a copper voice-coil sitting inside the Ferrite+ magnet. That’s because, as a pure bass driver, this driver doesn’t need to reproduce agile midrange tones – and so can have more moving mass. Power and control are front and centre. No gimmicks, no nonsense – just clean, stylish Danish design and craftsmanship. From the anodised brushed aluminium cover rings around the drivers, to the subtle Dynaudio logo atop the speaker grille, and the gently glowing light (which changes colour to let you know what the speaker is doing) we’ve made sure Focus 50 looks the part when sitting in a real living space. Run your fingers over the beautiful open-grained Blonde Wood and Walnut Wood finishes, or marvel at the glassy High Gloss Black and High Gloss White lacquer. Take in the shape of the gently tapered cabinet. Even the backplate has been given special treatment. Focus 50 is the ultimate premium wireless hi-fi system. True audiophile quality with all the benefits of modern digital streaming technology.

        "opis": "Go back to a time when all that mattered was the next track on the album. Contour 30i steps it up a notch from the 20i. Of course, it still treads the same path – one of honesty, transparency and sheer entertainment, but it puts it all in a bigger package. Like the rest of the Contour i family, the 30i has the Esotar 2i tweeter – complete with the Hexis inner dome found throughout our flagship Confidence range and also in the Core series of professional studio reference monitors (trickle-down tech is an amazing thing, isn’t it…). Esotar 2i also gets a larger rear chamber. This, together with Hexis, helps to reduce unwanted resonances and smooth out the frequency response for even clearer, sweeter high-frequencies. We’ve endowed Contour 30i with two 18cm MSP drivers, as well as doubling up on the rear ports. Behind the scenes we’ve tweaked the spider suspension (the springy ring that keeps the woofer in the right place when it’s at rest, and controls it in the right way when it’s moving). This one is made from aramid fibres, and retains the ingenious structural properties from before (the ribs are of varying width to give even finer control over the cone’s excursion). Contour 30i continues to use aluminium voice-coils, too. We can make them extremely light – but also bigger than the old-style copper units you’ll find elsewhere. Lighter weight allows larger diameters with more windings, yet low weight, which means we have more control over the cone movement. And that means more control over the sound – especially at high frequencies and high volumes – exactly what you need in a mid/bass driver. Sure, we experimented with small voice-coils on Contour i – the size other companies might use. The measurements said they should work for Contour i. Our ears said otherwise, so we went big. Our ears were right. And, as with Contour 20i, the flatter frequency response from the improved tweeter and mid/bass drivers means we’ve been able to simplify the crossover. Not that it wasn’t elegant before – but now… well, we’ll let you judge. The improved crossover no longer needs impedance correction circuitry to optimise its performance – that’s all now done in the driver itself, simply down to the physical properties of the materials we use. Fewer components, cleaner signal path, better performance. While our engineers and designers were hunkered down listening to everything from jazz, to classical, to metal, to electronica, the team in our on-site factory were scouring sustainable sources for high-quality materials and finishes. They make sure all Contour i's are furniture-grade: perfectly built, perfectly finished and perfectly packaged. \"They look classy, are impeccably finished and impress with their dynamic, detailed sound reproduction.\" \"This is why better sound is worth it.\" \"The Contour 30i goes further than this proud Danish brand has ever gone before.\" We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "The ideal companion to our upright Contour i's. The Contour 25Ci seamlessly integrates for an awesome surround-sound performance. It’s been said that sound accounts for as much as 80 per cent of the moviegoing experience. And we can’t argue with that (musicals, especially, don’t have quite the same impact with the volume set to zero). That’s why we created the Contour 25Ci centre-channel. Mix and match it with a combination of Contour 20i, 30i and 60i for a seamlessly integrated multichannel system – a system on which you know you’ll be able to enjoy stereo music as much as you will a teeth-rattling blockbuster. Because it’s essentially a Contour 30i turned on its side, with the tweeter moved to the middle. The super-detailed Esotar2i soft-dome unit – which now includes the resonance-defeating Hexis inner dome and a larger rear chamber – is flanked by a pair of 18cm MSP drivers – all of which use the same high-end lightweight aluminium voice-coils and (in the tweeter) magnetic ferrofluid technology as the rest of the Contour i range. Those mid/bass drivers are exactly the same as you’ll find in Contour 20i and 30i – complete with the asymmetrical aramid spider – for total consistency around your system. Our loudspeakers are used in music and movie production studios all over the world – so we know how crucial it is to reproduce multichannel sound to its fullest potential. And if you’re investing time in watching a movie (or even a TV show), you want that experience to be as clear, dynamic, assured and powerful as it can be. Most of the speech information comes out of the centre-channel, which is why Contour 25Ci’s combination of legendary materials and balanced, neutral sound is so ideal. That’s why the Contour 25Ci doesn’t compromise. All the knowledge, care and enthusiasm that goes into our upright speakers is here, too. The finish is furniture-grade; the materials top-quality. If you want a companion or an upgrade for your existing Dynaudio system, this is it. We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "Hear the difference: the Contour 20i is ready to blow your sonic socks off. Contour 20i has been designed to surpass every other standmount Contour model we’ve created. And it succeeds. The Esotar 2i tweeter is a turbocharged version of the much-loved Esotar2. It now features a larger rear chamber for more effective damping, and the inventive Hexis inner dome seen on Confidence, Core and more. Together they flatten the frequency response and reduce unwanted resonances for even clearer, smoother treble. The woofer has been tweaked, too. It’s still made of our own Magnesium Silicate Polymer (MSP) material, of course, it’s still powered by a lightweight aluminium voice-coil, and it still uses a vented dual-ferrite magnet system – but behind the distinctive black cone lurks an improved spider suspension. This one is made from aramid fibres, and retains the ingenious structural properties from before (the ribs are of varying width to give even finer control over the cone’s excursion). You’d be surprised at the sonic difference such a small change can make… And because those driver changes provide an inherently flat frequency response, we’ve been able to simplify the crossover too. It’s a thing of beauty, isn’t it? There’s no longer any need for extra impedance-correction circuitry – which means an even more direct signal path. And cleaner sound. Making a Contour without its signature baffle would be like making a car without wheels. Unthinkable. But there’s always room for improvement – and our designers love to stretch their legs.This baffleisaluminium,and set into the cabinet.Its chamfer is included in the driver’s basket – which not only looks great, but also reduces unwanted high-frequency diffraction effects for clearer treble, and provides a solid foundation for the drivers to do their work. A solid foundation means improved high-volume performance at low frequencies, too (although your neighbours might not thank us for that). Even the internal damping has been improved – using lessons learned from Evoke and Confidence. ‘There's nothing small about it, it's seriously good, real and captivating.’ \"If you care about refinement, purity and transparency, then the Contour 20i is worth considering.\" \"These standmounters are star performers.\" We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "If you have a bigger listening room – or if you just like to play it loud – the Contour 60i, with its unique midrange driver, is your new best friend. Contour 60i sounds bigger than you’d think. Yes, we mean that… And it isn’t just because it’s a grown-up, full-size, three-way floorstander. Of course it’s capable of outright, neighbour-infuriating volume. It sounds big in other ways too – from the soaring soundstage of a top orchestral recording to the caffeinated surround-sound effects in a movie, Contour 60i simply fills the room – without resorting to bass-heavy bombast along the way. You’ll find the jewel in the crown: the Esotar 2i tweeter. We looked at the older Esotar 2 from the 2016 Contour, took it apart and realised we could give it a boost with some tech from our flagship Confidence range (the Hexis) and also our flagship Core professional reference monitor series (the larger rear chamber). Together these clever mods help to reduce unwanted resonances and smooth out the frequency response for even clearer treble performance. Contour 60i is the only model in the family to have a dedicated midrange driver. It uses an aluminium voice-coil, and also has a neodymium magnet system – all developed and optimised at the Dynaudio Labs in Denmark. It is, in fact, exactly the same midrange driver we used in the 2016 Contour 60. If it ain’t broke… We’ve used more tech from Core here, isolating it in a precision-moulded cup containing resonance-defeating ribs. If there’s one thing you can never have too much of, it’s midrange clarity – and Contour 60i now has even more. The two woofers are updated. Each has a bigger magnet system, a different voice-coil design and a glass-fibres voice-coil former, as first used in the Confidence range and Sub 6 subwoofer. That means even tighter bass, at higher volume. We’ve chosen copper for these ones over aluminium. Why? Because they’re dedicated bass drivers. Copper is heavier and provides more moving mass. More moving mass lets us dig deeper without impinging on the midrange, handled by the super-sprightly driver just above. The crossover has been updated, too. You can’t change all the drivers without taking a look at the speaker’s ‘brain’, after all. Plus, the effect of that moulded midrange cup and the aramid fibre woofer spiders let our engineers shift the crossover frequency up. It now works better at slightly higher frequencies (up to around 300Hz). The frequency curve in this area is also flatter, meaning better midrange performance from a simpler design. The multi-layer curved cabinetand sleek-but-solid aluminium baffle provide your music (which was likely mixed using Dynaudio studio speakers, too) with a robust, defined acoustic foundation. So much so that, if we’ve done our jobs right, you’ll forget they’re even there and just ... listen. \"A technical and sound performance evolution.\" \"The Contour 60i is a choice you can't go wrong with.\" \"Physical yet delicate, forceful and fully formed.\" We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "It’s been said that the soundtrack is up to 80 per cent of the movie-going experience. And the centre speaker is the most crucial part of that. Say ‘hej’ to Emit 25C… It could be argued that the centre channel is the most important part of any surround-sound system. It’s where the lion’s share of dialogue comes from in a movie, and it’s where the focal point of the music often comes from in a multi-channel mix. It’s crucial to get it right. Emit 25C gets it right. It’s essentially an Emit 30, turned on its side, with the mid/bass drivers placed either other side of the tweeter. The drivers are the same; the crossover is the same, with a different box and port-tuning. But that’s not doing it a disservice; quite the opposite. It means you get total consistency between the centre speaker and the two flanking it (whether those are Emit 10s, 20s, 30s or even 50s), along with any others you place around your listening position. Emit 25C uses the same 14cm MSP woofers as Emit 10 and Emit 30. MSP stands for Magnesium Silicate Polymer. It’s a material we developed decades ago, and have been refining ever since for use in all our most legendary speakers (including Confidence, Contour, Heritage Special and many more). MSP provides exactly the right combination of lightness, stiffness and damping to reproduce your material with all the detail the artist wants you to hear. Each cone is made in one piece, with an integrated dust-cap. The ‘balance ribs’ you’ll see in the centre are bonded directly to the voice-coil, so the whole mechanism moves as one piece – bringing with it immense control and detail over its sound. The voice-coils themselves are made from lightweight aluminium wire, clad in a thin layer of copper. We’ve use aluminium here on the two-layer glass-fibre former because its weight doesn’t impede the driver’s movement. The copper layer means it can take more advantage of the magnetic energy generated by the dual-stacked ferrite magnet system. It magnifies that flux energy for more power – without sacrificing fleet-footed dynamics. Emit 25C has a high-performance Cerotar tweeter, along with all other Emit speakers – and the award-winning Evoke family. It’s based on the renowned Esotar Forty tweeter found in our Special Forty anniversary speaker, and features innovative technology that reduces unwanted resonance and optimises airflow. As with Evoke, Confidence and Contour i (among others), it also has a secret innovation: the Hexis. This is a small dimpled inner dome that reduces reflections to the back of the playing surface. You’ll hear its effect in the form of incredible detail resolution: sweet, smooth treble that doesn’t fatigue your ears – even during a long listening session. Emit 25C is available in three custom laminate finishes: Black, White and Walnut. They’re designed to complement each other, and blend seamlessly into your living room. That’s especially important for a centre channel, where (as much as we hate to say it), you should be spending more time looking at the picture above it than the speaker itself. Emit 25C is the lynchpin of your home cinema speaker system. Power, control and finesse, rolled into one compact unit.

        "opis": "Emit 10 is a compact two-way standmount speaker that uses technology derived from our ultra-high-end Confidence, Contour i and Evoke series. It’s the ideal model for smaller rooms and satellite channels in a home cinema system. Designed and engineered at Dynaudio Labs in Denmark, Emit 10 has been developed and tuned by the same minds behind our award-winning high-end families – right down to the smallest detail. Under the hood, you’ll find a 14cm MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) mid-bass unit. MSP is a material we developed ourselves, and have been using for decades. It provides exactly the right combination of lightness, stiffness and damping for super-fine control without loss of power – essential when a driver is reproducing both low-bass and crucial midrange frequencies.  Emit 10’s mid/bass driver is derived from the Esotec+ in the successful Evoke series. Its double magnet system gives better movement control and sensitivity, which means you’ll hear improved frequency response and dynamics at lower frequencies, while retaining crystal-clear midrange performance. That means you’ll hear what you want from a powerful rhythm section, plus guitars, vocals and more – all without distortion at louder volumes. You’ll notice that the dust-cap isn’t simply glued on. It’s part of the playing surface of the cone. The little dashed line around its edge – the balance rib structure – is bonded directly to the 38mm voice-coil behind it. It’s an incredibly strong connection with the motor, which means more of the coil’s motion energy is transferred to the diaphragm. The voice-coil itself is made of copper-clad aluminium wire. Aluminium is light, which gives the driver a fleetness of foot you might not find elsewhere, while the copper coating increases conductivity for more power. It’s a winning combination for detail and punch. A high-quality double ferrite magnet system provides the power. It’s a stacked design to keep it compact, but it serves another purpose: using two magnets means our engineers were able to control the magnetic flux, directing it back to the voice-coil, where it’s needed the most. (We can’t break the laws of physics, but we do rather like to bend them a bit.) The Cerotar tweeter is exactly what you’ll find in Evoke. It’s based on the one we’ve used in our award-winning Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter and the incredible Esotar3, which you’ll hear in Heritage Special and Confidence. It’s a 28mm fabric soft-dome unit with our special DSR (Dynaudio Secret Recipe) coating. Why fabric soft-dome tweeters? They convey all the detail and openness you could wish to hear from your recordings without subjecting you to unwanted fatigue over longer listening sessions. These are speakers you can (and, we hope, will) listen to late into the night. Behind the dome sits our much-talked-about Hexis device. It’s an ingenious dimpled inner dome that sits directly behind the playing surface and shapes airflow to optimise the frequency response and eliminate unwanted resonances. That means the diaphragm can move more precisely, so you’ll hear even more detail. It’s driven by a strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet system for more sensitivity, improved clarity and a natural, dynamic response. Emit 10’s crossover was designed by the same engineers that worked on Heritage Special and our Core range of professional studio reference systems. It uses a first-order design for the tweeter and a second-order topology for the mid/bass driver. We could’ve used a one-size-fits-all circuit, but that would mean compromising performance – and we’d much rather spend a little extra time to do it properly. We think you’ll agree when you hear them. Round the back, you’ll see the bass-reflex port. It’s a dual-flared design to reduce air turbulence and minimise unwanted ‘chuffing’, especially with deep notes. We’ve even tuned the internal damping material (yes, that’s possible). It’s measured down to the gram for the perfect combination of damping and openness. The cabinets are made from 18mm MDF, covered in beautiful custom laminate finishes. There are three available: Black, White and Walnut. All come with magnetic grilles, too – so if you want a different look, or someone small in your house is obsessed with poking and prodding your speakers with sticky fingers, you’re well covered. Emit 10 is the ideal way to take your next step into the world of hi-fi. Cutting-edge technology, simple Danish design and unmatched performance at this level.

        "opis": "Emit 30 is perfect for larger stereo systems or compact multi-channel home cinema set-ups in medium to large rooms. If you’re looking for a little more power from your system, you’ve found it. Emit 30 is a compact two-and-a-half-way speaker designed to impress whether it’s used as a stand-alone stereo pair or as part of a 5.1-channel (or more) home cinema. Like its little brother, Emit 10, it uses 14cm MSP woofers similar to those used in the Evoke series – this time doubled-up in each speaker for more low-frequency muscle, plus midrange clarity and punch. MSP stands for Magnesium Silicate Polymer. It’s a material we developed in-house for our woofer cones, and have used for decades – including on our most-lauded high-end models. MSP provides precisely the right combination of lightness, stiffness and damping (one we’ve tuned and honed over the years) to deliver control and outright power exactly where it’s needed. The cones are moulded in one piece; we don’t use a separate glued dust-cap. The little balance ribs around the edge of the centre are bonded directly to the voice-coil behind it, making the whole motor assembly one solid piece. Using fewer moving parts gives our engineers fine control over how the speaker moves – which, in turn, means fine control over how it performs. You’ll hear it as strong, tight bass and startlingly clear vocals, guitars and more. Even at eyebrow-raising volume. Each woofer is powered by a dual-stacked strontium carbonite Ferrite+ ceramic magnet system. Using two magnets means we can more effectively direct where the magnetic energy goes – it’s a lesson we learned developing the award-winning Special Forty anniversary series, and it’s thrilling to be able to use it in our entry-level family. The target for all that flux is the voice-coil. We use aluminium windings in Emit 30. Aluminium is light (which minimises inertia on the cone’s back-and-forth movement), and because it’s lighter than copper wire, it means we can pack more windings on to the two-layer glass-fibre former. More windings equals more power, and greater control over fine movement. There’s a twist, though (please pardon the pun): we’ve coated the aluminium wire in a very thin copper coating to further increase the control the amplifier has on the voice-coil. More force with only a fractional weight gain: win-win. While the twin 14cm mid/bass units deal with the… well, midrange and bass… the upper frequencies are handled by the tweeter. Emit might be an ‘entry-level’ speaker, but we certainly haven’t used any old unit off the shelf; witness the incredible Cerotar tweeter (the same as we use in Evoke). It’s based on the Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter and the Esotar Pro found in our Core studio reference speakers, and must be heard to be believed. The 28mm coated soft-dome diaphragm is backed up by the clever Hexis inner dome. The playing surface has been specifically engineered to produce ultra-clear, ultra-detailed high-frequencies without breakup (even at high volumes), while the Hexis smooths the airflow behind it to reduces unwanted resonances. An aluminium voice-coil and airflow magnet system provide the power. Cerotar is designed for high performance without listener fatigue – perfect if you’re given to long listening sessions (and you’re music lovers, so we bet you are). The bass-port on the back panel has dual flares (one inside; one outside), and has been tuned to minimise unwanted ‘chuffing’. It’s supplied with foam inserts that can be used to optimise performance for the speaker’s position relative to the wall. Emit 30’s cabinets are made from 18mm MDF to provide a solid, stable platform for the drivers to do their work. They’re internally damped with polyester fibre, measured down to the gram for exactly the right amount of resonance suppression. On the outside, you can choose from three custom laminate finishes: Black, White or Walnut. They’ve been chosen to complement any room, in any configuration (so if you’re mixing and matching Emit speakers in a home cinema system, you can make them stand out or blend in as you want). Emit 30: powerful floorstander performance in a compact package. If you want to take your listening to the next level, they’ll really make your collection sing. \"Emit 30 are able to fill the space between the upper registers and the bass with sufficient intensity to make the music convincing in its fidelity an... \"(...) every time I played them I ended up sitting myself down in my listening chair and enjoyed them for far longer than I had planned.\" \"The relatively handy speaker plays a lot bigger than you would think at first glance.

        "opis": "Emit 20 is a high-performance standmount speaker derived from our Evoke, Contour i and Confidence series. It gives a stellar combination of detail and punch for small to medium-sized rooms. We don’t use the term ‘authentic fidelity’ lightly. With Emit 20, that’s exactly what you’ll get: a premium audiophile speaker that astonishes at the price. It might be an ‘entry-level’ model, but Emit 20 is still crammed with technology that you’ll find in our other families, right up to the flagship Confidence range and our Core professional reference monitors. Make no mistake: you’ll experience performance you simply wouldn’t expect at this level. Emit 20 uses an 18cm MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) woofer, based on the one we’ve used in the Evoke series. MSP is a material we developed in-house, and have used for many years on our most renowned models. The cone itself is a one-piece design; the dust-cap is moulded as part of the playing surface, which gives it a solid connection to the voice-coil that moves it back and forth. You’ll hear that connection as supreme control and detail in the low and midrange frequencies. The voice-coil itself is aluminium, wound onto a two-layer glass-fibre former. We’ve a long history of using aluminium wire in our voice-coils – and for good reason. It’s light, so doesn’t impede fine movement, and we can get more windings on the former for a given length of wire. That means more ‘BL’, or magnetic power. More power means more punch. We’ve boosted that further, too, by coating the aluminium wire in copper. Combined with the stacked ferrite magnet system and new surround, that gives Emit 20’s long-throw mid/bass driver all the bass power you could want, even at high volumes, combined with amazing control over midrange frequencies (where instruments such as guitars, vocals and violins reside). Emit 20 uses the Cerotar tweeter directly from Evoke. It’s a 28mm soft-dome design that includes the ingenious Hexis inner-dome device. The coated fabric dome delivers sweet-sounding high frequencies – all the openness and detail the artists want you to experience in their recordings – while the Hexis smooths the frequency response and reduces unwanted resonance for surprising clarity. Cerotar is powered by a powerful Ferrite+ strontium carbonate ceramic magnet system. It gives the tweeter all the power it needs to play loud without breakup while maintaining all the nuance you could want. Even at neighbour-bothering levels. And because it uses technology from our top-of-the-range Core pro reference speakers (whose users need to listen intently for long periods), you won’t get tired when you’re in the middle of a long session. The mid/bass driver and tweeter are marshalled by a custom-designed crossover from the same team who brought you Heritage Special and Core. Our engineers used a hybrid first- and second-order topology for the tweeter and woofer respectively, giving them exceptional control over each driver’s behaviour. It means you’ll hear what the artist wants you to hear, without compromise. Emit 20 comes in three custom-designed laminate finishes – Black, White and Walnut – that beautifully complement the cabinets’ clean Scandinavian design (conceived in-house at our headquarters in Denmark). Black magnetic grilles come as standard in the box. We’ve even lavished attention on the cover-rings, which hide the mounting screws. They’re one-piece moulded with the surface finish embedded in the material, which eliminates the need for lacquer – so they won’t degrade over time. If you want an audiophile-level standmount speaker for a stereo set-up in medium-size room, or fancy a little more ‘oompf’ from your rear surround channels, Emit 20 is the ideal choice. \"It is such a performer.\" \"The Emit 20 boasts a great deal of naturalness, which is a rare quality in speakers of this price.\" \"With the Emit 20 Dynaudio offers a fantastic entry into the world of authentic high-end sound.\" We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "Whether you want to build a powerful stereo system, or really give your multi-channel films and music Blu-rays a boost in a medium to large room, Emit 50 has you covered. A pair of big floor-standing speakers makes a statement. With Emit 50, you can make that statement without giving your bank manager a heart attack. Its audiophile-grade technology and tuning deliver room-filling hi-fi performance at a price-level open even to those taking their first steps into high-end sound. Emit 50 delivers a level of power and finesse that, honestly, you could pay double the price for elsewhere. But why would you? Its twin 18cm woofers, 15cm midrange driver and 28mm soft-dome Cerotar tweeter are each dedicated to producing the clearest possible performance – at true cinema-level volume. Let’s give you the bottom line: Emit 50’s woofers dig deep. The two 18cm units (the same type used in Emit 20) use trickle-down technology from our high-end Evoke, Contour i and Confidence families to deliver astonishing low-frequency performance, well above the previous Emit range. It means the speaker can dig truly deep into the bass (-3dB at 33Hz, which equals Contour 60i and Confidence 60, if you’re into numbers), but allows us to keep the cabinet at a size that still fits your living room. The one-piece cones are made from our own in-house-formulated MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) material, complete with integrated dust-cap. Making drivers from one piece of material, rather than sticking on a separate piece, gives the playing surface a much better connection to the voice-coil behind it. And that means better control over their movement: less unwanted distortion and resonance, and more fine detail – even in the lowest notes. Unlike the other speakers in the series, Emit 50’s woofers use copper voice-coils. That’s because they don’t need to be quite as sprightly as they would when also handling midrange duties (as on Emit 20). So, we’ve used heavier copper for more outright punch. That’s intensified by the dual-stacked magnet system, which is optimised to direct its energy directly into the voice-coil. The midrange driver is a different beast. Exclusive to Emit 50, it’s derived from the version we used in the Evoke range – which, in turn, came directly from the high-end Contour series. It has a powerful ferrite ceramic magnet, a short version of the 38mm-diameter aluminium voice-coil (specifically optimised for midrange performance), and a lightweight surround. It’s designed for speed and precision: exactly what you need for reproducing nuanced vocals, orchestral strings and wind instruments, and more. Emit 50’s Cerotar tweeter is the same as you’ll find in the Evoke family. It’s a ground-up design that uses key technologies developed for our award-winning Special Forty anniversary speaker, plus Confidence and even our Core range of professional studio reference monitors. Our engineers are really proud of it, and rightly so. Cerotar’s 28mm coated fabric soft-dome diaphragm sits on top of another Dynaudio innovation: the Hexis. This ingenious dimpled inner dome is placed close enough behind the fabric to stop unwanted resonance reflecting back to the rear of the playing surface. It keeps the frequency response smooth for cleaner, sweeter treble – and more detail in your music. The tweeter is powered by a powerful Ferrite+ strontium carbonate ceramic magnet to give it more sensitivity. That translates to your ears as more authentic performance – you hear what you’re meant to hear; nothing more, nothing less. And because it’s so natural, it also reduces fatigue – so you can listen for longer. Emit 50’s crossover is a hybrid design. There’s a traditional Dynaudio first-order circuit for the tweeter, a second-order design for the midrange driver, and a fourth-order topology for the woofers. Sure, we could’ve just created a single design to cover them all – but that would mean compromising performance, which is something our engineers simply won’t do. The cabinets have been designed and tuned in-house in Denmark. They’re constructed from 18mm MDF, and damped with specially selected polyester material (yes, that’s tuned too) to make sure the drivers have the most stable platform possible. You can choose from three custom laminate finishes (Black, White, and Walnut), and black magnetic grilles come as standard. So if you want your speakers to stand out or blend in (or both), you can mix and match. It’s something you might want to think about if you’re creating a multi-channel system from scratch using Emit 50 alongside other speakers in the range. Whether you’re starting a brand-new high-end system from scratch, or upgrading from another system, Emit 50’s combination of power and finesse will bring a new level of performance to your music and films. \"Hours of enjoyable listening […] rediscovering familiar songs in new ways.\" \"What more can I say? The Emit 50 sound fantastic, look incredible, and are substantial: it's clear what we are paying for.\" \"(...) the Danes delivered a very nice compromise between high level stability, mild resolution and rich musicality across all genres, which should ap...

        "opis": "Put a pair of floorstanders in your living room and even the least ‘hi-fi’ person in the world will know you mean business. Put a pair of Evoke 30 floorstanders in there and they’ll also know you have taste. These two-and-a-half-way speakers strike the balance between compactness and restraint, and unabashed, wide-eyed enthusiasm for music. At the head of the table is the Cerotar 28mm precision-coated soft-dome tweeter. And it’s one of our most sophisticated yet. Our engineers plundered some of our most celebrated technologies – including ingenious airflow systems from the award-winning Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter, the precision coating found on the Contour range and the Hexis from the Confidence series (more on that in a bit) – and combined them into an original design specifically for the Evoke family. The Cerotar is driven by an improved strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet system, and features the Confidence’s headline-grabbing Hexis inner dome. This ingenious little dimpled device sits right behind the soft tweeter diaphragm and reduces unwanted resonances while smoothing out the overall frequency response. The result is sweeter treble, better detail and even more clarity – and that means you can listen into the wee hours of the morning without fatigue. Evoke 30’s twin 14cm Esotec+ mid/bass drivers are made from MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer), a material we’ve been using for our woofer diaphragms since Dynaudio started back in 1977. It provides exactly the right combination of lightness, stiffness and damping to balance the needs of powerful yet precise bass performance with clear, detailed midrange. Each speaker cone is made from a single piece of MSP. This makes them exactly the right amount of rigid – and means far less physical distortion when they’re playing. It also gives a super-solid physical connection to the glass-fibre voice-coil former on the back (it’s glued directly under the Balance Ribs you’ll see around the centre), which means more of the coil’s motion energy is transferred to the diaphragm. Evoke 30's 52mm voice-coils are made from aluminium – which provides the correct mix of weight and winding height to balance bass and midrange frequencies. It gives optimum moving mass while retaining the right grip of midrange performance for a perfectly integrated performance. Aramid fibre spiders keep everything centred and moving the way it should, while the Contour-derived surround allows a longer throw ratio for greater punch. And, like the Cerotar tweeter, Evoke 30’s woofers are both driven by ceramic Ferrite+ magnets for greater control, finesse and power. In non-speaker-designer language, that means “you’ll hear your music the way it was meant to be heard”. No rough edges, nothing standing out where it shouldn’t – and nothing relegated to a supporting act when it should be headlining. Evoke has been created for real life. Our designers’ priority was to make the whole family look great in any listening environment. They took models and prototypes home and sat with them, went and scoured interior-design stores and specialist furniture retailers and even sniffed around real houses to gain inspiration. Evoke 30 is available in four fantastic finishes. Black High Gloss and White High Gloss both use an improved lacquering technique that gives a gloriously deep, glass-like look. At the other end of the tactile spectrum are the lovely, natural open veneers of Walnut Wood and Blonde Wood – honest, organic andhygge. The result is an instant classic. It’s modern, retro, timeless and cutting-edge all at once. It’s the kind of speaker your kids will eye-up expectantly when they’re leaving for university. We’ll forgive you for hanging on to them yourself instead. We would…   \"I consider it a speaker that instantly establishes itself as a leader in its price segment and beyond.\" We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "Plug them in, turn them up, and then get a friend round. We’d put money on your pal asking where’s the rest of the speakers are. That’s when you smile, shrug and invite them to sit down in the sweet-spot on your sofa. And then turn it up a bit more. We’ve been creating speakers that perform out of all proportion to their physical size for over 40 years, and Evoke 10 is no exception. These are serious hi-fi… built for serious entertainment. Each speaker’s single 14cm long-throw mid/bass driver is made from MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer), just like all Dynaudio speakers have used for decades. They use updated surrounds to extend their throw, their frequency response and their low-frequency dynamics – all while maintaining stellar midrange performance. Want to know the woofer’s secrets? The diaphragm is 0.4mm thin, which provides exactly the right combination of lightness, stiffness and damping to ensure optimum performance. It’s made of one piece (the dust-cap is part of the playing surface), and is bonded directly to the rigid glass-fibre voice-coil former directly under the Balance Ribs you’ll see around the centre dome. That means the whole unit moves as one, in a predictable (and carefully tuned) way, for a performance that strikes the ideal balance between bass and midrange. The 38mm voice-coil itself is made from aluminium, making it extremely light. That means we can use more windings. More windings gives us more control over the cone’s movement, which means more control over the sound – even at high volumes and high frequencies. It’s kept stable, centred and true by the aramid fibre spider (the circular spring assembly that stops the cone moving when it shouldn’t, and lets it move when it should). And the whole assembly is driven by one of our powerful strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet systems. Up top is the 28mm Cerotar soft-dome tweeter. Our engineers looked behind the curtain of the award-winning Special Forty and money-no-object Confidence tweeters and cherry-picked some key technologies to bring to Evoke. The headline-grabbing component is the Hexis – an ingenious inner dome that refines the airflow behind the playing surface to smooth-out its frequency response and eliminate unwanted resonances. The Cerotar, like the woofer, is powered by a powerful Ferrite+ ceramic magnet assembly. Linking the drivers together is a high-grade second-order crossover that uses the Confidence’s design with different components. So, yes, when we say you’re getting high-end tech, we mean it. Evoke 10 is available in four beautiful finishes: Black High Gloss, White High Gloss, Walnut Wood and Blonde Wood.The shiny versions really are just that: improved lacquering techniques have resulted in a sumptuous, almost glass-like finish. The wood versions use a tactile, open natural veneer for either a warm, dark tone or a light apricot look. You might notice that you can’t see any mounting screws. Evoke has simple, clean trim rings that emphasise the cabinet’s finish as well as the moving parts of the drivers. The rings are one-piece moulded, with the surface finish embedded in the moulding process – so what we make is what you get. Clean, beautiful and honest. How very Danish. It means you can take them with you when you move… and, we trust, enjoy them for a lifetime. \"It inherits Dynaudio's sonic tradition: neutral, natural, authentic, and accurate.\" \"They are really engaging, lively, and fun-sounding speakers (...)\" “It’s thrilling.

        "opis": "It’s true that you can’t have too much of a good thing. Try as you might, some good things just won’t fit in your living room – but Evoke 20 will. Evoke 20 is a full-size stand-mounted speaker designed for almost any sized space. Its powerful 18cm mid/bass driver ensures it can flex its muscles when there’s heavy lifting to be done, while its 28mm soft-dome tweeter takes care of the fine detail. And, of course, its Danish design looks fantastic wherever you put it. It’s an ideal match. Evoke 20 has been designed by people who love music. They’ve crafted it from hundreds of hours of intensive measuring and listening – real listening, to real music, in real rooms. So when you play your collection, you know you’re hearing what they heard… something new. The 0.4mm thick, 18cm Esotec+ woofer is made from MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer), a proprietary material that we’ve been using in our speaker cones for decades. It provides the perfect balance of lightness, stiffness and damping that, combined with its strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet system, reproduces midrange and bass frequencies in perfect balance. The whole diaphragm is made from one piece of MSP. Rather than gluing on a dust cap or just leaving a hole, this construction makes the cone far more rigid – and means far less physical distortion. It gives a much better physical connection to the voice-coil, which means more of the coil’s motion energy is transferred to the diaphragm via the Balance Ribs around the centre. Evoke 20’s 52mm voice-coil is made from aluminium. We chose that over copper for this speaker because it gives the correct balance of weight and winding height to give bass frequencies power and enough mechanical and electrical damping, while also letting midrange frequencies (where a vast amount of musical detail lies) sing through clearly. An aramid fibre spider keeps everything centred and moving the way it should, while the seamless Contour-derived surround allows a longer throw ratio for greater power and punch. The tweeter is an original design. It’s called Cerotar, and is based on key technologies from our award-winning Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter and the mighty Esotar3, which you’ll find in the top-of-the-line Confidence series. Like all our other tweeters, it’s a 28mm unit and uses a precision-coated soft dome. This coating is applied in exactly the correct places and thicknesses to optimise high-frequency performance – it’s a process derived from the development of our most exclusive speakers. But that’s where the similarity to everything except Confidence ends. Hidden behind the dome is a part called the Hexis: a special inner dome that shapes airflow to smooth-out the frequency response and eliminate unwanted resonances that would affect high-frequency performance. As with the Esotec+ woofer, it’s driven by a strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet for increased sensitivity, improved detail resolution and a natural, dynamic response. That’s all a posh way of saying “it sounds really sweet, and you can listen to it for hours without even a hint of fatigue”. Time to get those prog-rock quadruple gatefold albums out of the attic… Our design department took field trips to show-homes, home-interiors stores and real-life dwellings in Denmark to hone Evoke 20’s look. It was important for them to be able to imagine the speakers in a variety of living spaces – because, after all, that’s how most people listen. They’re on a couch, with a coffee, and a dog… these speakers had to behygge. That’s why the four finishes are so relatable. You can choose from Black High Gloss and White High Gloss (which both use improved lacquering techniques for a stunning glass-like surface), as well as the warm and organic open-veneered Walnut Wood and Blonde Wood styles. The cabinets themselves are tapered and rounded in a nod to the Contour and Confidence ranges. The mounting screws are hidden behind stylish one-piece trim rings. And because good design doesn’t age, you know they’ll look every bit as stylish when you’re still listening to them in 30 years. Which, we hope, you will be. \"Subwoofer optional.\"  \"When 'hygge' and precision have a child.\" We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "Going to the movies is much better at home. You don’t have to queue, the floor isn’t sticky, and you don’t get charged through the nose for snacks. Plus, you can create a far superior audio experience. But for that, you need a centre channel. Director Danny Boyle said that sound makes for 70-80 per cent of the movie-going experience. And when you’re watching a film, the majority of that 70-80 per cent is reproduced by the centre channel. Evoke 25C is a dedicated centre speaker designed to integrate perfectly with any and all other speakers in the Evoke family – so you can bathe your ears in high-quality stereo just as effectively as you can shake the fillings out of your teeth with a summer blockbuster. The two-way design has one 28mm soft-dome tweeter and twin 14cm long-throw woofers. Like the rest of the Evoke range, the tweeter is the original design Cerotar. It’s based on key technologies from our award-winning Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter, and the mighty Esotar3, which you’ll find in the top-of-the-line Confidence series. Like all Dynaudio tweeters, it uses a precision-coated soft dome. This coating is applied in exactly the correct places and thicknesses to optimise high-frequency performance – it’s a process derived from our most exclusive speakers. But that’s where the similarity to everything except Confidence ends. Hidden behind the dome is a part called the Hexis: a special inner dome that shapes airflow to smooth-out the frequency response and eliminate unwanted resonances that would affect high-frequency performance. The Cerotar tweeter is powered by a strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet for increased sensitivity, improved detail resolution and a natural, dynamic response. That’s all a posh way of saying “even if you’re watching one of those box-sets that lasts for nine hours, your ears won’t get tired”. Which, of course, is exactly as it should be. Evoke 25C’s twin 14cm Esotec+ mid/bass drivers are made from MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer), a material we’ve been using for our woofer diaphragms since the dawn of Dynaudio. It provides exactly the right combination of lightness, stiffness and damping to balance the needs of precise bass performance with clear, detailed midrange. Each speaker cone is crafted from a single piece of MSP. This makes them exactly the right amount of rigid – and means far less physical distortion when they’re playing. It also gives a super-solid physical connection to the glass-fibre voice-coil former on the back (it’s glued directly under the Balance Ribs you’ll see around the centre), which means more of the coil’s motion energy is transferred to the diaphragm. The 38mm voice-coils themselves are made from aluminium, making them extremely light. That means we can use more windings. More windings gives us more control over the cone’s movement, which means more control over the sound – even at high volumes and high frequencies. That’s especially important in a centre speaker, which predominantly deals with speech – its midrange performance has to be absolutely top-notch. The woofer motor is kept stable, centred and true by the aramid fibre spider (the circular spring assembly that stops the cone moving when it shouldn’t, and lets it move when it should), while the Contour-derived surround allows a longer throw ratio for greater punch. And, like the Cerotar tweeter, the woofers are both driven by ceramic Ferrite+ magnets for greater control, finesse and power. In non-speaker-designer language, that means “you’ll hear your movie the way it was meant to be heard”. No rough edges, nothing standing out where it shouldn’t – and nothing relegated to a cameo when it should be the lead. Our design department took drew inspiration from show-homes, home-interiors stores and real-life dwellings in Denmark to hone Evoke 25C’s look. After all, it’s as much a piece of furniture as the couch you sit on to watch your movies. That’s why the four finishes are so relatable. You can choose from Black High Gloss and White High Gloss (which both use improved lacquering techniques for a stunning glass-like surface), as well as the warm and organic open-veneered Walnut Wood and Blonde Wood styles. The cabinet is tapered and rounded in a nod to the Contour and Confidence ranges, while the mounting screws are hidden behind stylish one-piece trim rings. Like a great movie, a great design doesn’t age. Evoke 25C will stay as timeless and thrilling as the classics you’re playing through it. “The Dynaudio Evoke Theater system is tailor-made for the home theater enthusiast who wants their speakers to complement their life, not complicate it... \"I consider it a speaker that instantly establishes itself as a leader in its price segment and beyond.\"  We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "If a pair of Evoke 50s in a room doesn’t say “statement of intent”, we don’t know what does. Use them in stereo. Use them as part of an Evoke multi-channel home cinema system. However you listen to them, the word ‘epic’ won’t be far from your lips. Evoke 50 is a full three-way floorstander with a 28mm soft-dome tweeter, a 15cm neodymium midrange driver and twin 18cm woofers. Evoke 50 features Dynaudio’s Cerotar tweeter. It’s a ground-up design that uses key technologies from the award-winning Esotar Forty anniversary tweeter, the awesome Contour series and the all-singing, all-dancing tech-fest that is Confidence. Our engineers are very proud of it. As well they should be. Just underneath the precision-coated dome sits an inner dome: the Hexis. This ingenious device is close enough to the back of the diaphragm that it stops unwanted resonant frequencies reflecting back to the rear of the playing surface. It smooths out the frequency response for clearer, cleaner, sweeter treble – meaning more detail, and more of those “hey, I don’t remember there being a triangle in this piece of music!” moments. The Cerotar is powered by a strontium carbonate Ferrite+ ceramic magnet system. That gives it more sensitivity, which, in musical terms, translates simply to ‘honesty’. You’ll hear just what you’re supposed to hear. And because it’s so smooth and natural, you can listen for hours without getting tired. Down at the bottom are two 18cm Esotec+ woofers. Like the Cerotar tweeter, they use trickle-down technology from the Contour and Confidence families to bring as much of that high-end DNA to Evoke as possible. The woofers are made from our own proprietary material, MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer). We’ve been using it in our cones for decades – and we’ve yet to find anything that gives a better balance of lightness, stiffness and damping. If it ain’t broke… But while the Evoke 20 standmount speaker uses aluminium in its 18cm woofer, Evoke 50 uses copper. That’s because these are pure bass drivers – they don’t need the fleet-footed agility of a dedicated midrange unit, so we were able to give them more moving mass. The 0.4mm diaphragm is the same, though, as is the Ferrite+ ceramic magnet. That means poweranddetail. It’s just one of the solutions arrived at through extensive analysis and simulation in our Jupiter measuring facility. Each speaker cone is crafted from a single piece of MSP. This makes them exactly the right amount of rigid – and means far less physical distortion when they’re playing. It also gives a super-solid physical connection to the glass-fibre voice-coil former on the back (it’s glued directly under the Balance Ribs you’ll see around the centre), which means more of the coil’s motion energy is transferred to the diaphragm. Aramid fibre spiders keep everything centred and moving the way it should, while the Contour-derived surround allows a longer throw ratio for greater punch. And, for extra versatility – if you rearrange your room or move house, for example – the rear-firing bass ports have two-part foam plugs. They offer three levels of tuning: fully open, half-open and fully closed, so you can tailor the speakers’ bass performance to their position and your room. Evoke 50 is the only speaker in the family to have a dedicated midrange driver, so the engineers in Dynaudio Labs decided to make it a little bit special. The 15cm unit they chose is derived directly from the high-end Contour range – which means a powerful neodymium magnet, a 0.4mm-thin diaphragm and a glass-fibre voice-coil former with a trademark Dynaudio aluminium voice-coil. Why neodymium and not the Ferrite+ of the woofers? Because it’s light, and it’s powerful. Why aluminium and not copper? Again, because it’s light (and lets us put more windings in the voice-coil for a given weight). That’s a combination that gives our team amazing control over how the driver responds – they were able to fine-tune it to integrate perfectly with the woofers and tweeter. In fact, the Evoke team did such a good job that you essentially are getting Contour-level performance out of this midrange driver. Creating a speaker this large without making it seem bulky and boxy is no mean feat – but lead designer Louise Dalgaard met the challenge head on. And then she knocked it out of the park. Evoke 50 was the first in the range to be committed to paper (and then to 3D modelling program, to clay model, to full MDF prototype and finally to The Real Thing). Louise and her team were adamant that Evoke 50 had to be realistic for real homes and real lives. They drew inspiration from furniture designers, interior-design showcases, show homes, and even sniffed around real-life dwellings to get the look just right. The result is an instant classic. It’s modern, retro, timeless and cutting-edge all at once. It’s the kind of speaker you’ll still be looking at in 30 years, and thinking to yourself that it makes the rest of your belongings look a little humdrum by comparison. Evoke 50 is available in four beautiful finishes. Black High Gloss and White High Gloss both use a lacquering technique that gives a gloriously deep, glass-like look. At the other end of the tactile spectrum are the lovely open natural veneers of Walnut Wood and Blonde Wood. Plug them in and rediscover your love of music. \"Combines monitor-like resolution with relaxing transparency and a cornucopia of sonic colours.\" \"Combines monitor-like resolution with relaxing transparency and a cornucopia of sonic colours.\"  We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "True bass.Adding 18S to your monitors will open up a new world of performance that lets you mix and master with painstaking accuracy… and deliver tracks that translate beautifully to any playback system. We’ve applied advanced DSP modelling technology that acoustically matches 18S to any Dynaudio Pro Studio Monitor from BM Classic, LYD and upwards, turning two-way systems into three-way set-ups. Its punch is delivered by two of our brand-new MSP+ Hybrid Drive units and a 500W amp for absolute control and power. Getting the 18S to match seamlessly with our professional monitors is key for absolute accuracy when mixing and mastering. That has meant assessing the acoustic characteristics of each of our popular high-end studio speakers and creating custom performance maps for each one. And it’s future-proof: when we add new studio speakers to the line-up, we’ll release a firmware update for the 18S to add their performance maps – so it can grow along with your needs and equipment. With this information at its disposal, the 18S’s display and menu system lets you select the specific Dynaudio speakers you’re using in your monitoring setup. This means the roll-off can be tailored perfectly to suit. And, if you combine a LYD 48 stereo or surround setup, you’ll essentially have a full-blown four-way monitoring system at your disposal. The 18S has a selection of RCA or XLR connections for flexibility with your studio setup, and comes with a number of handy features to help more advanced systems too. This includes the ability to set a time delay to ensure the sub and speakers are working perfectly in sync: all you need to do is enter the distance from the sub to the speakers and the sub adjusts itself automatically using both time and phase delays. There’s also a full three-filter parametric EQ to easily defeat room modes that could affect the accuracy of your final recording. We’ve designed a brand-new driver for the 18S. This one is made from aluminium rather than our standard Magnesium Silicate Polymer material. It has paper backing and an MSP dust-cap on the front. Why the sandwich? Because a subwoofer requires a different balance between stiffness, lightness and damping than standard speaker drivers. The new MSP+ Hybrid Drive units have been designed specifically with subwoofers in mind for the best performance possible. Adding 18S to your monitors will open up a new world of performance that lets you mix and master with painstaking accuracy… and deliver tracks that translate beautifully to any playback system.

        "opis": "True bass.The 9S subwoofer is designed to complement LYD and other Dynaudio Pro studio monitors, including the classic BM range. Studio-quality components and construction make the 9S, with its double front baffle and brand-new 9in long-throw driver, the ideal subwoofer for your mixing and mastering projects. We made it a priority to make the 9S compact while ensuring that you get the utmost sonic accuracy. In terms of size, it resembles the BM 9S II that it replaces, but when it comes to performance, it’s actually more comparable to the larger BM 14S II. The 9S will expand any studio monitor setup regardless of whether you’re working in stereo or surround. Its massive yet tight low-end takes the burden off your monitors – letting them focus on delivering the frequency range above 50-150Hz, depending on how you set the crossover filter. A long-throw driver ensures the necessary movement to reproduce super low-end frequencies all the way down to 22Hz in great detail. Running the show is a 300W Class D amplifier module that significantly outperforms the previous BM 9S II.

Combine it with one of our subs and eight or 10 surrounds, and it forms an excellent system for immersive monitoring, including Dolby Atmos HE 7.1.4 and 9.1.4. The bass section consists of a 30cm MSP driver with 100mm ferrofluid-cooled voice coil. The midrange is a 17cm MSP driver with 75mm ferrofluid-cooled voice coil and neodymium magnet. Up-top is the legendary Esotar 3 soft-dome tweeter. The mid and tweeter are linked by a high-power passive crossover. Want a horizontal version to put above or below screens or windows? We have you covered; it uses twin 24cm bass drivers instead of the single 30cm unit. These speakers are supplied as an active two-way with two DCA stereo power amplifiers incorporating built-in crossover cards, or a DA40 with onboard DSP (this for a stereo pair).

        "opis": "The M4 by Dynaudio Acoustics is a high quality, high-power loudspeaker system for use in large music studio monitoring applications. It’s been designed to provide accurate, distortion-free monitoring at high power levels – maintaining exceptional quality at all times under all drive conditions. The bass section consists of four 300mm MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) drivers with 100mm ferrofluid-cooled voice coils. The low-mid section uses two 170mm MSP drivers with 75mm voice coils and neodymium magnets. The upper-midrange driver is a 54mm critically doped fabric dome Esotar model that ensures low distortion and excellent transient response. And the high-frequency unit is the legendary Esotar 3, designed to reproduce distortion-free transients of up to 1000 watts. Both Esotar units are fitted with enhanced double-magnet motors, and a high-power passive crossover links the high-mid and tweeter. If you’ve a smaller room, you can also order a compact version of the system with two bass drivers.

        "opis": "Core 59 brings the pinnacle of precision, consistency and reliability to your studio. This is what performance sounds like. When you’re working with art – whether it’s someone else’s or your own – you need equipment you can trust. A professional producer or engineer is part of the creative process, and his or her ears are the most trustworthy tools they have. They know what sounds good, and they know that a good reference monitor can help them make a good performance great. Core 59 – the flagship of our high-end professional reference monitor series – is that monitor. This three-way speaker features uncompromising class-D amplification, cutting-edge digital signal processing, a super-inert 32mm-thick baffle and a flat bass response down to 36Hz at -6dB. It’s a serious system designed for serious audio professionals. Core 59 has been made for the highest-demand environments that recording engineers, mixers, producers, and editors work in – and has been specifically designed to solve many of the monitoring issues that career professionals face every day. Listener fatigue is the thorn in the side of every studio engineer. Once it sets in, you’re done for the day. Core 59’s Esotar Pro tweeter has been created to keep fatigue at bay so you won’t be finished before the mix is. We’ve long been known for our sweet-sounding soft-dome tweeters. They provide hours of pinpoint imaging and detail without the tiring quality that’s common to other designs. The Esotar Pro builds on this heritage with the ingenious Hexis device. It’s an inner dome that sits just behind the diaphragm and optimises airflow, smooths the frequency response and eliminates unwanted internal resonances. The result is outstanding imaging, transient detail, and effortless high frequency response. The speaker’s 5in midrange driver provides staggering detail. It uses our proprietary MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) material in its cone for the best combination of lightness, stiffness and damping and, coupled with an aluminium voice-coil, has an incredibly fast response and authoritative control from its neodymium magnet system. With crossover points at 385Hz and 5kHz, Core 59 delivers so much more of the critical vocal range in one driver than typical designs, ensuring your mix decisions on vocal balances and dialogue subtleties are made with total confidence. Core 59’s bass driver has emerged from over 18 months of intensive study into subwoofer driver technology, including our18S subwoofer, which dives all the way down to 16Hz. The outcome of that research is an improved copper voice-coil and glass-fibre former, pushed by ceramic magnets and a 500W class-D Pascal amplifier. It gives the 9in long-excursion woofer even more grip on the bottom without sacrificing a deep frequency response. And because each driver is handmade in our factory in Denmark (we produce 1.4 million drivers each year for our home hi-fi, custom-install, in-car and pro-studio speakers), we can maintain incredible consistency. That means you can use Core monitors in multiple studios and have them all sound and perform at the same high level – everything you need to hear, everywhere you go. Should you need to replace a driver, you can either do it yourself and calibrate it to within 0.2dB as on the AIR series, or have your service centre do a full factory-level calibration. When we revolutionised studio monitoring with the AIR series, we also revolutionised speaker positioning. Literally. AIR made it possible to use a three-way speaker in multiple orientations without compromising the midrange driver and tweeter’s phase response by using sealed midrange and tweeter assemblies that can be rotated in the cabinet. Core 59’s Orbit baffle rotates too, so you can use it in left, right, or centre-channel orientation. You can even position the woofer above the tweeter/midrange assembly to accommodate placement in front of a console in an LCR array. Since every application is unique and monitors may need to be placed in a variety of environments – on their sides, vertically or sometimes even inverted – we’ve given Core 59 indentations on all four sides. Just fit our special Dynaudio pads to protect the cabinet's finish and stabilise it on the mounting surface. Core 59 is also compatible with standard VESA mounting brackets or our custom K&M bracket should you want to mount them on walls or the ceiling as part of a multichannel or immersive-audio reference system such as Dolby ATMOS. The AIR series was famous for its advanced DSP system. But our acoustic engineers don’t believe laurels are for resting on, so they’ve constantly been looking for better and more innovative ways of doing it. That work has resulted in some great leaps in DSP sophistication – but also in the way it’s applied in everyday use. You, our users, wanted something easier to use, and that’s exactly what you get with Core – with even better performance. Positioning is critical when installing a monitor system. That’s why each Core 59 has two DSP filter switches to address its position and boundary locations. For example, if you place the monitors on the meter bridge of a large-format mixing console, set them to ‘Desk’. This will help compensate for the first reflection created by the mixing surface. On the other hand, if you put the monitors into a purpose-built wall, setting the Position 1 filter to ‘Soffit’ will compensate for the increased bass response. Boundary effects created by placing a monitor close to walls or a ceiling can be compensated for by adjusting the Position 2 filter between ‘Wall’ or ‘Corner’. These filters help compensate for the reflections created by the boundary walls, especially in the lower frequencies. There’s also a low-frequency 80Hz Linkwitz-Riley cutoff that can be engaged if you’re using Core 59 with a subwoofer to extend the low frequency response. Users can also alter the overall presentation. Core 59 uses the same concept as the LYD series Sound Balance filter – a different design to typical shelving-EQ tweeter and woofer adjustments found on most active monitors. Instead of simply fine-tuning the tweeter level up or down, which will affect phase response, Core 59 uses a full-spectrum band-pass filter that tilts depending on the desired tonal response. In the ‘Dark’ setting, the entire frequency response is tilted so that 20kHz is down -1.5dB, while 20Hz is up +1.5dB. In ‘Bright’, the tilt is reversed (+1.5dB at 20kHz and -1.5dB at 20Hz). This gentle filter maintains the proper phase response between the drivers while providing the tone that meet your tastes. The changes are subtle, but often this little tweak is enough to make the sound balance just right. The noise-floor and signal resolution of any monitoring system is critical to its performance. Whether you’re using the analogue or digital inputs, you need to be able to control the gain staging between the monitor controller and the speaker system. We’ve provided a range of 0dBu to +24dBu to match the analogue input sensitivity to the output level. Once optimised, Core 59 processes all analogue signals at a 192kHz sampling rate and 64-bit resolution in the DSP (from the 24-bit analogue-to-digital converter) for the greatest degree of mathematical precision. There’s a switch to determine the maximum output SPL with the greatest bit-depth in the DSP. If you want the maximum level, set this to 112dB. If you work mostly at lower levels, choose a lower SPL setting to optimise the bit-depth of the DSP for both inputs. When using the AES digital inputs, you must determine which channel (left or right) of the AES stream is used for that monitor. Core 59’s DSP operates at the incoming sample rate and either locks to the digital audio clock or word clock to maintain the most accurate signal possible. We’ve designed Core 59 for you. We’ve designed it to be used however and wherever you need it – whether that’s for near-field, mid-field or main monitoring, or in soffit-mounted set-ups. It’s made for music mastering, mixing, and recording; theatrical re-mixing; editorial and sound design for games or anywhere else you need an uncompromising critical monitoring system. Core 59 is ready to be installed in high-SPL immersive audio and other multi-channel environments with both analogue and digital connectivity, DSP controlled acoustic response, and versatile positioning. That means complete tonal consistency whatever your monitoring needs. It really does give you everything you need to hear.

        "opis": "Trust is critical in this business. Whether you’re recording a power-trio or an orchestra, mixing a solo voiceover or video-game soundtrack, or mastering a full immersive audio project (such as a Dolby ATMOS mix), you need to know that your monitors reproduce everything you need to hear – warts and all. Core 7 has been developed alongside industry professionals with exactly this in mind. It’s the most compact model in our range of high-end professional reference monitor systems. This no-compromise two-way design features two class-D amplifiers (one 500W amp for the mid/woofer and a 150W unit for the tweeter), plus the best of modern DSP technology and a flat bass response down to 38Hz – 31kHz +/- 6dB and 45Hz – 27kHz +/- 3dB. It’s been specifically designed and engineered to meet the challenges of high-demand environments that recording engineers, mixers, producers, and editors work in all day, every day. Our acoustic designers are always improving on driver design for each model – and when they wheeled Core 7 out for listening tests, you could genuinely see the pride on their faces. Each driver unit is handmade at our factory in Denmark. And because we produce 1.4 million drivers each year for the home hi-fi, custom-install, in-car and pro-studio markets, we can ensure extreme consistency. That makes it possible to use Core monitors in multiple studios and have them all sound and perform at the same high level – giving you everything you need to hear, everywhere you use them. We’re known for our soft-dome tweeters. They provide hours of pinpoint imaging and detail without the listener fatigue common to other designs. Core 7 builds on this heritage with the original Esotar Pro tweeter – the latest breakthrough in our engineers’ obsessive attention to driver detail. Advanced manufacturing techniques and our astonishingJupiter testing facility, have let our designers take tweeter design to a new level with the revolutionary Hexis system. Hexis optimises airflow, smooths frequency response and eliminates unwanted internal resonances. The result? Jaw-dropping imaging and transient detail, and effortless high-frequency response. But they weren’t happy to leave it there: Core 7’s mid/woofer driver is another leap forward. We’ve taken our proprietary MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) cone material along with aluminium voice coils, glass-fibre formers and advanced magnet designs to produce drivers capable of the kind of accuracy and honesty you’d never thought possible. MSP provides the best combination of lightness, stiffness and damping – making it capable of producing deep, accurate bass while also delivering natural midrange detail, all in one driver for the best imaging and point-source delivery. The active Dynaudio AIR series was famous for its advanced digital signal processing. Our acoustic engineers continued this forward-thinking approach by taking the past 18 years’ worth of DSP innovation and applying it in a simple, easy to use system with the Core series. Make no mistake, though: under the hood is a sophisticated system that makes light work of challenging studio environments. Positioning is critical when installing a monitor system. That’s why each Core 7 has two DSP filter switches to address its position and boundary locations. For example, if you place the monitors on the meter bridge of a large-format mixing console, set them to ‘Desk’. This will help compensate for the first reflection created by the mixing surface. On the other hand, if you put the monitors into a purpose-built wall, setting the Position 1 filter to ‘Soffit’ will compensate for the increased bass response. Boundary effects created by placing a monitor close to walls or a ceiling can be compensated for by adjusting the Position 2 filter between ‘Wall’ or ‘Corner’. These filters help compensate for the reflections created by the boundary walls, especially in the lower frequencies. There’s also a low-frequency 80Hz Linkwitz-Riley cutoff that can be engaged if you’re using Core 7 with a subwoofer to extend the low frequency response. Users can also alter the overall presentation. Core 7 uses the same concept as the LYD series Sound Balance filter – a different design to typical shelving-EQ tweeter and woofer adjustments found on most active monitors. Instead of simply fine-tuning the tweeter level up or down, which will affect phase response, Core 7 uses a full-spectrum band-pass filter that tilts depending on the desired tonal response. In the ‘Dark’ setting, the entire frequency response is tilted so that 20kHz is down -1.5dB, while 20Hz is up +1.5dB. In ‘Bright’, the tilt is reversed (+1.5dB at 20kHz and -1.5dB at 20Hz). This gentle filter maintains the proper phase response between the drivers while providing the tone that meet your tastes. The changes are subtle, but often this little tweak is enough to make the sound balance just right.  The noise-floor and signal resolution of any monitoring system is critical to its performance. Whether you’re using the analogue or digital inputs, you need to be able to control the gain staging between the monitor controller and the speaker system. We’ve provided a range of 0dBu to +24dBu to match the analogue input sensitivity to the output level. Once optimised, Core 7 processes all analogue signals at a 192kHz sampling rate and 64-bit resolution in the DSP (from the 24-bit analogue-to-digital converter) for the greatest degree of mathematical precision. There’s a switch to determine the maximum output SPL with the greatest bit-depth in the DSP. If you want the maximum level, set this to 112dB. If you work mostly at lower levels, choose a lower SPL setting to optimise the bit-depth of the DSP for both inputs. When using the AES digital inputs, you must determine which channel (left or right) of the AES stream is used for that monitor. Core 7’s DSP operates at the incoming sample rate and either locks to the digital audio clock or word clock to maintain the most accurate signal possible.  We’ve made sure Core 7’s cabinet is as stiff and inert as we could make it – hence the 32mm thick baffle, which contributes to its excellent linearity across the spectrum. Since every application is unique and monitors need to be placed in a variety of environments – either on their sides, vertically or sometimes even inverted with the woofer above the tweeter – we’ve designed Core 7 with indentations on all four sides. We’ve even developed special pads that can be placed in order to protect the cabinet's finish and stabilise the cabinet on the surface. That goes for multi-channel set-ups, too: we also have custom K&M brackets to mount Core 7 in orientations suitable for surround sound, immersive audio (such as Dolby ATMOS) and other custom configurations. Core 7 is designed for maximum flexibility and performance where its compact size is desirable. This includes recording studios, edit suites, broadcast trucks, mobile facilities, broadcast and theatrical dub stages, immersive audio mixing rooms and custom installations. And because its size doesn’t diminish its performance either in frequency response or output SPL, it plays seamlessly with Core 59 monitors in calibrated multi-channel monitoring systems. Stop second-guessing. Core delivers everything you need to hear.

        "opis": "Studio professionals need to trust the monitors they use every day. They need to know recordings will sound the same at 10pm as it did at 10am. And they need to know that they don’t need to worry about listener fatigue. Most of all, they need to be secure in the knowledge that they’re hearing everything that was recorded – warts and all – so they can make the best mixing decisions. Trust is something that’s earned in this industry and Core 47 is ready to earn yours by giving you the most accurate reproduction that the latest technology and more than 40 years of expertise can provide. And when we say ‘accurate’, we really mean it: all Core monitors are calibrated to within a reference of 0.2dB at our factory in Denmark. You can install 100 and they’ll all perform to the same high standard. Core 47 is the mid-size model of our flagship professional reference monitor series. Our engineers codenamed it ‘Bulldog’. You’ll know why when you fire it up. This compact three-way monitor features an eyebrow-raising 500W + 500W + 150W of Class-D power from Pascal amplification, as well as sophisticated digital signal processing and a flat bass response down to 44Hz at -3dB, and 37Hz at -6dB with a gentle roll-off. And it reaches all the way up to 31kHz – never let it be said monitoring can’t give you a real high. Let’s start at the top. Dynaudio studio monitors have always been famous for their revealing detail. The Esotar Pro tweeter takes the word ‘revealing’ to a new level. It’s the culmination of our engineers’ obsessive attention to driver detail, and uses innovative airflow technology (as well as a powerful neodymium magnet) to ensure that what went in, comes out. Advanced manufacturing techniques and extensive measuring in our Jupiter testing facility have resulted in the ingenious Hexis inner dome. It sits just behind the tweeter diaphragm and optimises airflow to improving thermal response and eliminating unwanted internal resonances. The result is the best imaging, transient detail, and effortless high frequency response. It’s the kind of tweeter you can listen to long into the night during marathon mix sessions. Full detail and clarity, but no fatigue. The 4in midrange driver provides staggering detail. It uses our proprietary MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) material in its one-piece cone for the perfect balance of lightness, stiffness and damping. That, coupled with an aluminium voice-coil and neodymium magnet system, means an incredibly fast response and authoritative control. With crossover points at 475Hz and 5.25kHz, Core 47 delivers so much more of the critical vocal range in one driver than typical designs, ensuring your mix decisions on vocal balances and dialogue subtleties are made with confidence. Core 47 and Core 7 share the same woofer. However, in a three-way design, this driver can focus on delivering deeper bass since midrange duties are handled by the 4in driver. This helps deliver the lower frequencies deliver awesome clarity, while the amplifier’s power and gentle roll-off let your ears (and your recordings) take full advantage of all the depth on offer. And, most importantly, all this deep energy is tonally accurate, letting you equalise bass instruments, kick drums, and all those subwoofer “booms” in the movies. And because each driver is handmade in our factory in Denmark (we produce 1.4 million drivers each year for our home hi-fi, custom-install, in-car and pro-studio speakers), we can maintain incredibly small tolerances and deliver exceptional imaging. This consistency in each driver means you can use Core monitors in multiple studios and have them all sound and perform at the same high level – everything you need to hear, everywhere you go. The Dynaudio AIR series was famous for its advanced DSP system. But times have changed, and our acoustic engineers are restless folk… so they’ve spent the intervening 18 years innovating. That’s resulted in some great leaps in DSP sophistication – but also in the way it’s applied in everyday use. You wanted something easier to use, and that’s exactly what you’ve got – with even better performance. We’ve given Core 47 the power to optimise itself for differing acoustic environments. There are three settings: Anechoic, for when the monitors are placed on stands in rooms that have sufficient dampening treatment (such as recording studios and dubbing stages); Desk, for when they’re on a workstation or meter bridge; and Soffit, for when they’re mounted in properly designed wall soffits as part of an overall architectural acoustic design. And that’s not all: you can also set boundary filters that compensate for walls or corners where low-frequency room modes can be triggered. We’ve marked the speakers ‘left’ and ‘right’, but tweeter position depends on your room. Core 47 can be used tweeters-in or tweeters-out, depending on the room and listening position. Users can also alter the overall presentation. Core 47 uses the same concept as the LYD series Sound Balance filter – a different design from the typical tweeter and woofer adjustments found on most active monitors. Instead of simply adjusting the level of the tweeter up or down, which will affect phase response, Core 47 uses a full-spectrum band-pass filter that tilts depending on the desired tonal response. In the ‘Dark’ setting, the entire frequency response is tilted so that 20kHz is down -1.5dB while 20Hz is up +1.5dB. In the bright setting, the tilt is reversed (+1.5dB at 20kHz and -1.5dB at 20Hz). This gentle filter, unlike traditional shelving EQs, maintains the proper phase response between the drivers while providing the tone that meet your tastes. The noise-floor and signal resolution of any monitoring system is critical to its performance. Whether you’re using the analogue or digital inputs, you need to be able to control the gain staging between the monitor controller and the speaker system. We’ve provided a range of 0dBu to +24dBu to match the input sensitivity to the output level. Once optimised, Core 47 processes all analog signals at a 192kHz sampling rate for the greatest degree of mathematical precision from the advanced DSP processor. When using the AES digital inputs, there are two settings: one to determine which channel (L or R) of the AES stream is used for that monitor, and a second to determine the maximum output SPL. If you want maximum output SPL, set this to 112dB (124dB peak for a pair half space). If you work mostly at lower levels, choose a lower SPL setting to optimise the bit resolution of the AES input for the best linearity. When using the AES input, Core 47’s DSP operates at the incoming sample rate and either locks to the AES clock or incoming word clock to maintain the most accurate signal possible. That means if you work in 48K, for example, you can send the signal straight to your speakers in 48K. It’s as simple as that. Unlike other competitors there is no sample-rate conversion. You give it 192, it does 192. We’ve made sure Core 47’s cabinet is stiff and inert, so all the vibration energy goes where it’s supposed to. That’s why we’ve given it a super-thick 44mm bezel, which contributes to its excellent linearity across the spectrum and means you can place it anywhere for a wide range of uses. We call them left and right, but you can use them tweeters-in or tweeters-out depending on your room and positioning. As with all Core speakers, we’ve put versatility high on our priority list. Since every application is unique and monitors need to be placed in a variety of environments – either on their sides, vertically or sometimes even inverted with the woofer above the tweeter – we’ve designed Core 47 with indentations on all four sides. We’ve even developed special isolation pads that can be placed in order to protect the cabinet’s finish and halt vibrations from the mounting surface. That goes for multi-channel set-ups, too: we’ve also designed special brackets have to mount Core 47 in orientations suitable for surround sound, immersive audio and other custom configurations. As the global success of our LYD 48 series has shown, there’s great demand for compact three-way studio monitors. Rooms might be getting smaller, but we all remember how it was mixing on big three-way mains… Core 47 is designed for maximum flexibility and performance where its compact size and superb midrange detail are desirable. This includes music recording studios, TV dub stages, edit suites, broadcast trucks, ADR facilities, and game authoring suites. It also makes an excellent surround monitor in broadcast and theatrical dub stages – including multi-channel immersive-audio rooms and custom installations. And because its compact size doesn’t diminish its performance either in frequency response or output SPL, it’s incredibly easy to integrate with other Core series monitors in calibrated, multi-channel monitoring systems. Core 47 is a no-compromise three-way professional monitor that delivers the best modern DSP-optimised performance, effortless power, and classic Dynaudio heritage in a compact enclosure designed for every audio professional.

        "opis": "Core Sub is the ideal low-frequency extension for all speakers in the Core studio monitor range. And when we say ‘low’, we mean it: it digs down with a flat response to 15Hz with a 6dB roll-off at 13.5Hz. There’s no meaningful low frequency that it won’t reproduce utterly faithfully. Combine its handcrafted cabinet – made at our factory in Denmark – with four of our latest low-frequency drive units and 1000W of Pascal class-D amplification, and you get a subwoofer worthy of supporting the ground-breaking Core speakers. Core Sub uses the same DSP engine found in all theCore speakers, which means you can customise its response based on where it’s placed in the room. Its analogue and AES digital inputs let you calibrate it to work in any configuration from single-channel extension through 2.1-channel bass management and on to a theatrical LFE channel with the headroom to really nail it. Put your Cores in HP and you’re ready to go. By using the same electronic platform as the rest of the Core products, we can ensure that the Sub’sbehaviourand tonality are identical to the monitors – which means you get a totally integrated system, not a separate product just for bass. It’s physically integrated, too. The design makes it possible to stack more units and combine it with other Core products. You can even use the VESA mount if you want to get it up on the wall. And it’s mix-and-match. For example: add two Subs per side with a Core 47 in between, regulate the dB and all is aligned – both physically and sonically. (Although we can’t promise your gold discs will stay in the same place on the wall.) Each Sub delivers 120dB, integrating perfectly with the power on offer from the rest of the Core series. It’s versatile, too – it’s digital and analogue, you can stack up to three together and on the top there are indentations to perfectly align any core monitors. Core Sub has four 9in side-firing handmade Dynaudio hybrid woofers – Dynaudio’s new MSP+ Hybrid Drive units – which are made primarily from aluminium for stiffness, and are designed specifically for subwoofers. To counter ringing from the aluminium, it utilises a dual-action damping system that combines paper dampening on the back of the driver and Dynaudio’s own Magnesium Silicate Polymer material in a dampening cap on the front, ensuring the best performance. This driver is an improved version of the one you find in the highly acclaimed 18s woofer. The quest was simple; make the best bass driver possible. Make no mistake: Core Sub isn’t just another boom-box. This is a highly accurate low-frequency delivery system. Get ready to be moved. Literally.

        "opis": "Demand for content only ever increases, while it seems physical studio space seems to go the other way. If you’re working in immersive audio, where you might need up to 16 speakers in your room, that can be an issue. Luckily for you, then, the compact Core 5 professional reference monitor is specifically designed for smaller rooms and nearfield monitoring. Core 5 is the most compact model in our range of high-end professional reference monitors. It’s a two-way nearfield design that’s been created to work in cramped spaces in a stereo configuration, or to provide width and height support in an immersive set-up. And, crucially, to give you usable SPL for those jobs – so if you’re in an OB truck or a smaller mix-stage, you won’t strain to hear, and your eardrums won’t be blasted. That’s courtesy of the twin class-D Pascal amplifiers in each speaker: one 280W unit for the mid/woofer and 280W for the tweeter. Couple that with the advanced DSP tech on-board, and you’ll get a flat bass response down to 45Hz at -6dB, and 51Hz at ±3dB. Impressive for a speaker this size, we think you’ll agree. Up top you’ll find a 28mm Cerotar Pro tweeter. Like all other Core speakers (and all other Dynaudio speakers, for that matter), it uses a precision soft-dome diaphragm in conjunction with a Hexis resonance-defeating inner dome. It’ll play up to 30kHz – so you’ll get all the detail you need – while still remaining a relaxed listen. That’s crucial if you’re working for a long session (once fatigue sets in, you might as well go home for the night). The 5in woofer digs down to 45Hz. It’s made from our proprietary MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) material – which provides precisely the right combination of lightness, stiffness and damping to produce the kind of accuracy that’ll make your hair stand on end. Make no mistake: these are revealing speakers. If there’s a problem in your mix, they’ll let you know about it. On the other side of the simple back panel is the most advanced digital technology we could cram in. We’ve given Core 5 the same future-proof innovation as the rest of the range; the culmination of decades of research and development into exactly what studio professionals need. Each speaker has two DSP filters to help you compensate for position and boundary locations. If they’re on your desk, there’s a switch for that (cunningly called ‘Desk’), which deals with first-reflections from the mixing surface. Got them on stands or brackets further away? Choose ‘Anechoic’. And if they’re in a purpose-built wall, ‘Soffit’ is your go-to. Then you can drill-down into ‘Free’, ‘Wall’ or ‘Corner’ modes to compensate for reflections. There’s also a low-frequency 80Hz Linkwitz-Riley cutoff for use with a subwoofer. You know your room better than anyone, which is why we’ve gone even further and given you Sound Balance options to change Core 5’s overall presentation between ‘Bright’, ‘Neutral’ and ‘Dark’. These are much more than the typical shelving filters found in other brands: these ones use a full-spectrum band-pass filter that tilts depending on the sound you want. In ‘Dark’ mode, you’ll get a 1.5dB decrease at 20kHz, and a 1.5dB increase at 40Hz. ‘Bright’ swaps to the inverse of that. Doing it this way means phase response is maintained between the drivers, which means timing is kept spot-on… which means your soundstage remains crystal-clear. Precision is everything, whether you’re using analogue or digital inputs. That’s why we’ve given you the option to control the gain-staging between the monitor controller and the speakers. Using the analogue inputs? There’s a dedicated switch to give you between 0dBu and +24dBu to set the maximum analogue input level for the Core 5. You can also set the maximum output SPL with the greatest bit-depth. Set this to 96dB (reference -20dBFS) for the peak SPL of 116dB for the maximum level, or optimise the bit-depth for both inputs for lower-level listening, switching to 79dB (reference -20dBFS). If you’re in a digital workflow, set which AES3 stream channel is going to the monitor using the ‘Digital channel’ switch. The DSP will operate at the input sample-rate (with no sample-rate conversion), and can either lock to the digital audio clock or the word clock for ultimate accuracy. The AIR series was famous for its advanced DSP system. But our acoustic engineers don’t believe laurels are for resting on, so they’ve constantly been looking for better and more innovative ways of doing it. That work has resulted in some great leaps in DSP sophistication – but also in the way it’s applied in everyday use. You, our users, wanted something easier to use, and that’s exactly what you get with Core – with even better performance. Positioning is critical when installing a monitor system. That’s why each Core 59 has two DSP filter switches to address its position and boundary locations. For example, if you place the monitors on the meter bridge of a large-format mixing console, set them to ‘Desk’. This will help compensate for the first reflection created by the mixing surface. On the other hand, if you put the monitors into a purpose-built wall, setting the Position 1 filter to ‘Soffit’ will compensate for the increased bass response. Boundary effects created by placing a monitor close to walls or a ceiling can be compensated for by adjusting the Position 2 filter between ‘Wall’ or ‘Corner’. These filters help compensate for the reflections created by the boundary walls, especially in the lower frequencies. There’s also a low-frequency 80Hz Linkwitz-Riley cutoff that can be engaged if you’re using Core 59 with a subwoofer to extend the low frequency response. Users can also alter the overall presentation. Core 59 uses the same concept as the LYD series Sound Balance filter – a different design to typical shelving-EQ tweeter and woofer adjustments found on most active monitors. Instead of simply fine-tuning the tweeter level up or down, which will affect phase response, Core 59 uses a full-spectrum band-pass filter that tilts depending on the desired tonal response. In the ‘Dark’ setting, the entire frequency response is tilted so that 20kHz is down -1.5dB, while 20Hz is up +1.5dB. In ‘Bright’, the tilt is reversed (+1.5dB at 20kHz and -1.5dB at 20Hz). This gentle filter maintains the proper phase response between the drivers while providing the tone that meet your tastes. The changes are subtle, but often this little tweak is enough to make the sound balance just right. The noise-floor and signal resolution of any monitoring system is critical to its performance. Whether you’re using the analogue or digital inputs, you need to be able to control the gain staging between the monitor controller and the speaker system. We’ve provided a range of 0dBu to +24dBu to match the analogue input sensitivity to the output level. Once optimised, Core 59 processes all analogue signals at a 192kHz sampling rate and 64-bit resolution in the DSP (from the 24-bit analogue-to-digital converter) for the greatest degree of mathematical precision. There’s a switch to determine the maximum output SPL with the greatest bit-depth in the DSP. If you want the maximum level, set this to 112dB. If you work mostly at lower levels, choose a lower SPL setting to optimise the bit-depth of the DSP for both inputs. When using the AES digital inputs, you must determine which channel (left or right) of the AES stream is used for that monitor. Core 59’s DSP operates at the incoming sample rate and either locks to the digital audio clock or word clock to maintain the most accurate signal possible. We’ve designed Core 59 for you. We’ve designed it to be used however and wherever you need it – whether that’s for near-field, mid-field or main monitoring, or in soffit-mounted set-ups. It’s made for music mastering, mixing, and recording; theatrical re-mixing; editorial and sound design for games or anywhere else you need an uncompromising critical monitoring system. Core 59 is ready to be installed in high-SPL immersive audio and other multi-channel environments with both analogue and digital connectivity, DSP controlled acoustic response, and versatile positioning. That means complete tonal consistency whatever your monitoring needs. It really does give you everything you need to hear. Simple answer: anywhere you want. Core 5 can be stacked (we’ve added indentations to the surface to locate them precisely in place with other Core speakers and Subs), mounted on stands, and hung vertically or horizontally from our optional brackets. You can even invert them with the woofer above the tweeter. Core 5 is designed for any nearfield scenario: so if you’re short on space in your OB truck, edit suite, mobile facility or immersive room, you know you’ll be able to get the precision you – and your audience – demand. No more second-guessing. It delivers everything you need to hear.

        "opis": "We know, and we agree: if the space exists for it, the full-size Core Sub is the way to go. More is more, after all. But for many studios, space is already lacking – and with rooms getting filled with ever more equipment thanks to increasing demands for immersive content, having a compact system that still packs a punch is more important than ever. In size, Core Sub Compact is half a Core Sub. In performance, you’ll get everything you demand. It digs down to 16Hz. It’ll put out 100dB at a listening distance of 1m (in a small studio, you’ll definitely know it’s there). It has a full set of DSP controls from the rest of the Core family. It uses 280W of high-quality Pascal amplification for each of its twin drive-units. And it won’t take up valuable floor or wall space. We challenge you to find a meaningful low frequency it can’t handle, whatever your project. Core Sub Compact might be smaller in size, but in processing power it’s a giant. It uses the same amp module and DSP engine you’ll find in the rest of the Core family – which means you get all the customisation options you want, plus all the I/O connections you’d ever need. Analogue, AES digital… you can deal with everything from a 2.1-channel system right up to a full-on 9.1.6 immersive rig. It also means total consistency with the rest of the Core family, regardless of which combination of speakers you use. Core Sub Compact’s tonality is identical to its higher-frequency cousins – it really is an integrated bass-extension system, not just a boom-box You can use more than one Core Sub Compact in your system for more even bass-distribution. They’ll happily sit underneath or behind a desk, directly underneath a Core speaker (thanks to the built-in location indentations) or on a wall, courtesy of a standard VESA bracket. And you don’t have to worry about vibration. The two Dynaudio MSP+ Hybrid Drive units work in an opposed configuration. Combine that with the ultra-stable cabinet and you can mix at maximum SPL with your priceless Ming vase sitting right on the sub. Worry-free. The Hybrid Drive is a clever thing – specifically engineered for subwoofers. The rigid aluminium core is sandwiched between a layer of paper damping on the rear, and our proprietary MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) material in a cap on the front to eliminate ringing. Put the whole thing in front of a muscular ferrite magnet system and you’ve an incredibly solid engine for bass. Plus, you get two… Reference monitoring is all about trust – and solid bass-management is crucial in letting you know exactly how your material and room really sound. Core Sub Compact is the way to hear it.  We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "Intelligent design. An instant system, tailored for you. The Dynaudio Custom Studio S4-LCR65 system lets you create personalised vertically or horizontally oriented left, centre and right three-way speaker channels. And it’s a breeze to install… even between stud bays. Its intelligent modular design means incredible flexibility: the S4-LCRMT mid/tweeter and S4-LCR65W woofer modules fit around standard 16in studs (so you don’t have to cut them away). You can position the tweeter either way up and at any height in the array (so the listener gets total focus). And the individual modules are easily connected using speaker wire, with their frames either connected together and installed in a single cut-out, or spaced apart in multiple cut-outs to create a bespoke single channel (so the possibilities are immense). Like the rest of the Dynaudio Custom range, all the modules mount into their frames without any tools required. The frames use a special integrated counter-spring mechanism that prevents unwanted sonic vibrations while keeping everything solidly connected in the installation. Each module uses a passive crossover with a three-position switch, pre-configured to standard LCR channel configurations that use one or two connected woofer modules. There’s also a bypass position to enable an unlimited number of fully active and completely customised S4-LCR65 system setups with external DSP processing and a dedicated amplifier channel for every driver. The S4-LCR65 system has five different optional paintable white grilles that attach magnetically (four standard-sized and one customisable), and it can also be installed behind acoustic fabric or acoustically transparent screens. And, of course, it uses the same materials and technologies that have made our other loudspeakers so legendary: soft-dome tweeters, MSP cones and large aluminium voice-coils. Classic Dynaudio heritage in a brand-new configuration.

        "opis": "Wall of sound.Simple installation, simple finishing, simply brilliant. It isn’t fun cutting through studs in walls. It isn’t fun dealing with the extra bracing required. It isn’t fun cleaning up the sawdust. So don’t put yourself through it… The Dynaudio Custom Studio series S4-LCR65 system is modular; its separate woofer and tweeter modules are designed to fit snugly in the spaces between standard American 16in on-center wall-studs. That means you can configure a full three-way LCR array with no modifications – and no more effort than it takes to spec the rest of the system. The tweeter modules can be placed either way up to optimize the system for the listening position, while a rear switch lets you match their power setting to the number of woofer modules you’ve chosen. There’s also a passive filter bypass setting to unlock an unlimited range of fully active LCR system configurations. Our engineers wanted to make it as easy as possible to install a larger array in one go, which is why magnetic fastenings hold everything securely together if you’re not separating the modules. The S4-LCR65 system also uses the exact same unique clamp-and-lock mechanism as the rest of the Dynaudio Custom Studio range.  You want ease of use? You’ve got it. Dynaudio Custom Studio series rectangular in-wall speakers use some ingeniously simple technology to get you up and running with minimal fuss… and at maximum speed. The frames are pre-installed during construction or renovation (the house can be finished around them). Then, when it’s time, your expert installer comes to mount and fine-tune the speakers – so it’s exactly right, first time. All without damaging the décor or having to pull anything apart. Like the Studio series round in-ceiling speakers, the rectangular in-wall versions have a tweeter-level switch and include paintable magnetically attached grilles for an even more personalized set-up. And, of course, they use Dynaudio’s legendary 1in soft-dome tweeter and MSP driver technology – the same stuff you’ll find in our celebrated hi-fi, automotive and pro-studio speakers. We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

The S4-C65 might be the smallest in-ceiling speaker in Dynaudio’s Custom Architectural Studio range, but you’d never know from its performance. The 17cm mid/bass driver takes some cues from Dynaudio’s high-end speakers – such as positioning its magnet system inside the voice coil, to keep things sounding as they should… even when it’s turned up to 11. This complements the 28mm precision-coated soft dome tweeter, which can pivot to direct sound exactly where it’s needed in the room. Like the rest of the Studio range, the S4-C65 couldn’t be simpler to install and, once it’s in place, can be cleverly re-positioned through 360 degrees should you decide to have a furniture reshuffle. Not just that, but paintable grilles, in round or square designs, mean you can customise their design to suit you.

How? By making it totally adjustable… The S4-DVC65 dual voice-coil in-ceiling speaker brings even more flexibility to the Dynaudio Custom Studio range. Its dual tweeters let you listen to either a mono or stereo signal from a single speaker unit – perfectly suited for hallways, closets, bathrooms and situations where you don’t have space for more than one speaker installation. Like the conventional Studio series round speaker units, the tweeters’ level can be adjusted. And because you can angle them, you can aim the sound exactly where you want. A separate switch on the back lets you use the speaker in dipole mode for surround applications. The added bonus? You get another stellar Dynaudio voice-coil – wound from aluminium rather than copper, for its superior power-handling, cooling and energy-transfer properties.  The frames of our round in-ceiling speakers retrofit into many popular and existing cut-outs, while the patent-pending baffle latches mean super-quick, super-simple tool-free mounting.The main driver is angled 18˚ and can rotate 360˚ in its frame, while the tweeter can be positioned – and adjusted – for precise directional control. There’s also a tweeter-level switch for even more fine-tuning. The magnetically attached grilles can be painted to blend in with (or stand out from) the room’s décor, and can be used interchangeably with optional square versions to effortlessly integrate into any space. Like all the models in the Dynaudio Custom Studio range, they feature the same 1in soft-dome tweeter technology and proprietary MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) woofer design that you’ll find in our cost-no-object Evidence Platinum flagship loudspeaker.

        "opis": "Decades of Dynaudio speaker expertise built in to your walls No visible wires, no fuss – just great sound. The S4-W65 from the Dynaudio Custom Architectural Studio range is an in-wall speaker with no compromises. The smaller of the two in-wall options, it makes the perfect companion for small to medium-sized rooms, offering a 17cm mid/bass driver to support its 28mm precision-coated soft-dome tweeter. Like our in-ceiling options, the S4-W65 fixes on to a pre-installed frame, which can be fitted either way up for total flexibility. The patent-pending baffle latch makes mounting the speakers a breeze, and the frames even retrofit into many existing popular-sized cavities, so you don’t have to start from scratch if you don’t want to. Changing your décor? No problem. The Dynaudio Custom Studio range can adapt as your room does, with paintable magnetic grilles that can be swapped out as quickly as your colour scheme changes.

        "opis": "Stereo from a single source.Slimline in-ceiling speaker with a 6.5in woofer and dual voice-coil tweeter. If you need to install a stereo set-up into a space too tight for two speakers, you’ll naturally turn to a DVC (dual voice-coil) set-up. But what if the space is tight depth-wise too? Either you have to modify the ceiling itself (probably not an option), or you have to compromise by using a shallow version of an existing speaker (which could have implications for audio presentation). The P4-DVC65 provides a third option: no-compromise stereo sound-quality in a chassis that will fit cavities as little as 76mm deep. Installation is as easy as introducing the frame to the hole and letting them get to know each other by clamping the doglegs onto the drywall. Then simply twist and lock the speaker into place. You don’t need tools, and you can do it with one hand (which you might be grateful for if you’re jammed up against the ceiling on top of a ladder). The speaker uses MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) in its 6.5in woofer, and a coated soft-dome diaphragm in its 28mm tweeter. They’re both technologies we’ve used for decades in some of our most legendary speakers – so you know you’re getting the best there is. Final finishing is quick and simple, too, thanks to the paintable magnetic grille. Just match the colour to the room, then let it snap itself in place. Job done.

Whether you’re installing overhead speakers for a Dolby ATMOS system in a fancy home-cinema room, or you’re specifying a distributed audio system for bedrooms, the kitchen and so on, you need to know your speakers are up to the job. And in these systems, consistency is crucial. The P4-C65 is slim enough to fit into cavities as little as 72mm deep, so even if you’re dealing with varying spaces between rooms, you can ensure that the audio delivery is identical across the whole installation. The frame fits in place using ingeniously simple doglegs, which simply squeeze onto the drywall material by hand. Then the speaker simply twists and locks into place. You can do it one-handed – a reassuring thought when you’re standing on top of a high stepladder. And you don’t even need any tools. The P4-C65 uses a soft-dome tweeter, along with a 6.5in MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) woofer – materials and technologies you’ll find in our high-end home, pro and car systems. The tweeter can also be adjusted to compensate for room character; -3dB, 0dB and +3dB settings are available. The paintable magnetic grille completes the picture, helping the speaker blend into the room – so it’s only heard, not seen.

And it’s all housed in a one-piece chassis that secures into place with the turn of a few screws.You can fine-tune the tweeter’s response to -3dB, 0dB or +3dB to really tailor the speaker to the room.

For larger rooms, or for situations where you want a little more power from your overhead Dolby ATMOS or distributed audio system, the P4-C80 – with its 8in woofer – could be your saviour. Especially if you’re working in a tight space. The speaker will fit in cavities right down to 87mm deep, meaning you can keep the system totally consistent between rooms or hallways, even if the ceiling space varies at times. Fitting is a model of simplicity: put the frame in the hole, squeeze down the doglegs to secure it around the ceiling material, then just twist and lock the speaker into place. You don’t need tools, and you don’t even need two hands. The P4-C80 uses the same materials and technologies that have made Dynaudio so legendary in the high-end audio business for decades. The woofer is made from MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer), a proprietary material we developed in the late 1970s and have used ever since. The tweeter is a soft-dome design – variations of which have appeared in some of our most awe-inspiring speakers. And it’s all been tuned and refined by the same people who made those speakers so great. The final touches are just as easy as the installation itself. Paint the grille to match the room’s décor, then let it snap itself into perfect alignment with its built-in magnets. Your audio is in good hands.

        "opis": "Engineered to entertain.A new foundation for custom audio: clear, deep, undistorted bass that dives all the way down to 16Hz. High-quality low-frequency delivery for the most demanding installation projects. Sub RCC installs in walls and ceilings, either into standard 2x4 stud-bays before construction or on the surface afterwards using the supplied adapter kit. We can hear the question already: “Subwoofers and drywall? But…”. Don’t worry. With Sub RCC you don’t need to be concerned about rattles. It uses Reactance Cancelling Configuration (RCC) technology derived from Dynaudio’s pro studio subwoofers: two drivers work in opposition to each other to eliminate vibration in the speaker and the wall or ceiling. The whole assembly is housed in a special aluminium enclosure that has a trick up its sleeve: to keep things simple when it comes to specifying the right sub for the job (surface-mount or between studs), we’ve included brackets for both situations in the box. No more having to second-guess if the project scope might change. Two magnetic grilles are also supplied for different installations (retro-fit and pre-fit) – and they can be painted too, for a seamless finish. For amplification, we’ve teamed up with the experts at AudioControl in the US. The resulting RS 500 DSP-controlled unit is precisely matched and tuned out of the box for the Sub RCC with Dynaudio EQs and limiters. Installers can also tweak the unit’s graphic EQ if needed. And don’t worry if you're working with more than one sub: each amp can power two Sub RCC units for even more flexibility.

A 12' woofer, featuring a die-cast aluminium frame, is integrated into a metal baffle in a sealed cabinet. Mounting the driver to the cabinet follows Dynaudio's established design principle where a multi-layered sandwich construction is employed: Fusing the thick, stiff metal baffle to the MDF enclosure is a sheet of special dampening material. This construction effectively eliminates any unwanted resonance and serves as the perfect foundation to optimize the fast and powerful transient signals from the driver. It is powered by a 250 Watt amplifier utilizing the innovative Dynaudio CEC (Cone Excursion Control) technology, and features full remote control operation of all adjustments: Selecting level, phase, cross-over frequency, extended bass mode, and the four individual memory presets. Its back panel is outfitted with both RCA and XLR inputs and outputs, the master/slave switch, as well as the memory protect switch. The subwoofer driver may be concealed from view by the elegantly sculpted removable black fabric grill, which is itself attached to the baffle via concealed magnets.

        "opis": "A subwoofer serves to provide more to a system than simply add deep bass. Incorporating a subwoofer to augment the low frequency performance of any stereo or multi-channel loudspeaker system offers an additional benefit: by reducing the strain on the speakers in terms of reproducing extreme bass information, the overall quality of midrange frequencies and the soundstage reproduction in general are greatly improved.The High- Pass filter on the Sub 250 crossover enhances the general performance and imaging of the main speakers by reducing inter-modulation distortion. The SUB 250 model is the most compact sub-bass solution from Dynaudio.Utilizing its powerful 10\" woofer in a sealed enclosure that measures less than a cubic metric foot, the Sub 250 delivers a very high level of performance in multi-channel or sub/sat applications where only a modest sized subwoofer would fit.Incorporating a 200 Watt amplifier, its back panel features a selectable gain setting, a variable Low-Pass Filter (50 Hz to 150 Hz), and a selectable phase switch (0º or 180º). There is one LFE RCA input and output, as well as an RCA SAT/SUB Input and an RCA SAT output.The SAT High-Pass Filter is also selectable (Flat, 60 Hz, or 80 Hz). The band-pass filtered inputs and outputs make it perfectly suited as a mate for any of the Dynaudio compact monitors in a high quality sub/sat stereo system, where it would produce a purely audiophile grade performance.

        "opis": "The most compact Dynaudio subwoofer The Sub 250 II is the most compact Dynaudio subwoofer and the ideal solution for use in home theatres, stereo systems and subwoofer/satellite systems where only a modest sized subwoofer would fit. The Dynaudio Sub 250 II is equipped with a powerful 200 W amplifier and long-throw 24 cm woofer in a compact sealed-enclosure design. The combination of its long-throw woofer design, large 100 mm voice coil and the cone made from Dynaudio’s own MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) material enables the Sub 250 II to deliver deep yet precise and detailed bass that perfectly matches the sonic character of the Dynaudio main speakers. An ideal match between the main speakers and the subwoofer is the most overlooked part in a subwoofer-enhanced system, but the Sub 250 II will blend in seamlessly, bringing more substance and depth to any Dynaudio two-channel or surround setup. Together, the sealed cabinet enclosure, the cubic shape, the rigid MDF construction and the forward firing woofer offer remarkable bass precision and make the Sub 250 II easy to position in any room. The amplifier circuit incorporates variable gain setting, a variable Low-Pass Filter (50 Hz to 150 Hz), and a selectable phase switch (0º or 180º). The audio signal can be fed from an AV Receiver's Subwoofer/LFE output into the LFE Input (1 x RCA), or from a Stereo Amplifier's Pre-Out into the SUB Input (2 x RCA). A selectable High-pass Filter (Flat, 60 Hz, or 80 Hz) enables the SAT Output (2 x RCA) to facilitate a crossover integration between the Sub 250 II and the main speakers. Bass performance can be further enhanced by using a multi-sub configuration with two or more subwoofers in parallel. For this use, the Sub 250 II is equipped with a ”slave” function, which by-passes all settings on the rear and adapts the settings from a ”master” subwoofer. By positioning multiple subwoofers in a room the bass is generally more evenly dispersed, thus effectively improving the overall sound quality of the system. Two or more smaller subwoofers can even result in an ultimately superior bass performance than that achieved via one large subwoofer. Available in an elegant Satin Black or Satin White lacquer, as well as in Rosewood or Walnut real wood veneer finishes, the Sub 250 II perfectly and discreetly integrates into any room and every décor scheme.

Incorporating a subwoofer to augment the low frequency performance of any desktop or multimedia loudspeaker system offers an additional benefit: by reducing the strain on the speakers in terms of reproducing extreme bass information, the overall quality of midrange frequencies and the soundstage reproduction in general are greatly improved.The high-pass filter on the Sub 250MC crossover enhances the general performance and imaging of the main speakers by reducing inter-modulation distortion. The Sub 250MC model is the most compact sub-bass solution from Dynaudio.Utilizing its powerful 10\" woofer in a sealed enclosure that measures less than a cubic metric foot, the Sub 250MC delivers a very high level of performance in multi-channel or sub/sat multimedia applications where only a modest sized subwoofer would fit.Incorporating a 140 Watt amplifier, its back panel features a selectable gain setting, a variable low-pass Filter (50 Hz to 150 Hz), and a selectable phase switch (0º or 180º).

The Dynaudio Sub 600’s high-performance 300W amplifier powers the 30cm driver in a sealed cabinet. It’s designed to deliver serious weight, authority, punch and power for those critical thunderous movie moments, but remain supple, precise and musical enough to bring something extra to stereo music on your hi-fi. It can connect to any AV receiver or stereo preamp, and you can fine-tune the satellite speakers’ crossover point (flat, 60Hz or 80Hz) via a selectable high-pass filter to ensure seamless integration with the rest of your system, whatever size or configuration you’re using. And because the sub takes the real heavy lifting away from the other speakers in your set-up, they can do their job under less low-frequency strain – meaning even better midrange performance and improved soundstaging. You can even link more than one sub together in a master/slave configuration. Why? To better avoid room nodes and deliver a much less directional performance in the bass, while providing even more headroom for when things get hectic on-screen or in your music.

The Excite X38’s twin 18cm woofers use our own ultra-lightweight, ultra-rigid Magnesium Silicate Polymer (MSP) material, extraordinarily large 75mm diameter aluminium voice coils with powerful centre-magnet systems, and high-strength die-cast aluminium frames. That’s how the X38 achieves its resounding bass, thrilling dynamics and incredible control. The 14cm midrange driver also uses MSP, ensuring seamless integration with the woofers, while the 28mm tweeter’s coated fabric dome guarantees fine high-frequency detail. With its meticulously selected crossover components and optimised dispersion characteristics, the X38 combines energy and dynamism with a remarkably balanced, three-dimensional portrayal of the recording. The extensively braced cabinet is available in a choice of fine natural wood veneer or satin lacquer finishes, while the removable cloth grille is discretely secured via concealed magnets. It also has integrated outrigger feet: depending on the flooring surface, the X38 can stand on four resonance-absorbing rubber feet or four height-adjustable retractable spikes.

        "opis": "Musical purity and the highest resolution: The Dynaudio Excite X12 provides high-end sound from an ultra compact enclosure. Even the smallest nuances are reproduced precisely and authentically. The silky-smooth yet extremely detailed high frequency performance is due to the further improved Dynaudio specially coated soft dome tweeter, a legend in its own right. It is mounted as close as possible to the mid/bass driver in order to achieve the most precise soundstage, acting as an ideal one-point source of sound – where music simply sounds right. This is also achieved through the finely tuned crossover which, as in every Excite model, features ceramic resistors, air-copper-coils and high quality internal cabling. The impedance is constant and linear over the entire frequency range, thus providing an easy load to any amplifier.The strict use of highly rigid die-cast aluminium driver baskets in all Excite models further enables a clear, pure, undistorted reproduction of music to be achieved. The Excite X12 is compact high end purity for an exceptional music experience – one that may be relived again and again.

        "opis": "Impressive realism for convincing home cinema: The Dynaudio Excite X22 is a universal center channel loudspeaker that combines maximum sonic performance with minimum cabinet space. Movie sound effects and musical soundscapes from DVD and HD discs truly need to be reproduced naturally in order to fully impress. The sound simply must fit to the colourful, sharp, high-resolution picture. With its completely originally-developed compact mid/bass and tweeter drive units, the X22 presents sound in brilliant shades and vivid detail. Thanks to its bass-reflex construction, the compact speaker even reproduces the deepest notes. The basis for this high level of performance is an extremely rigid cabinet construction which is particularly anti-resonant, thus also reducing the effects of vibration from the surface beneath it. An ideal dispersion angle is attained via the integrated metal plinth. With the Dynaudio Excite X22 Center, movie sequences come to life if full authenticity, music becomes vivid – multi-channel music and home theatre will be a truly deep and extremely moving experience.

Why midrange drivers? Because they further improve clarity and imaging – even in larger rooms and at longer listening distances. Precise crossover tuning ensures they work in absolute harmony with their bass- and treble-focused cousins, too.

We’ve matched each amp specifically to the driver it powers, so you don’t have to worry about system-matching or interconnects, and you can even tell the speakers where they are in the room (in a corner, in free space and so on) to let them fine-tune their sound for you. All you need is a source. Want more? The high-pass filter (60 or 80 Hz) allows one to optionally combine the Excite X14A with a subwoofer.

        "opis": "The exemplary performance of the Dynaudio Excite X16 renders maximum enjoyment from a compact design: Powerful bass, natural midrange, and transparent highs - with any genre of music, on any system. Featuring an improved 18 cm woofer, the X16 effortlessly reproduces deep bass notes even in larger rooms. Impressive dynamics are a result of one Dynaudio forte: The large high density ferrite magnet and an especially long but lightweight aluminium voice coil. The coil always moves precisely within the magnetic field, even during the most dynamic pulses. With very dynamic recordings played at the highest volumes, the loudspeaker remains precise, detailed and undistorted. This powerful driver system is so efficient that high volumes can even be reached without a high-powered amplifier.The soft dome tweeter matches this controlled performance, remaining clear, detailed and linear, up to the highest frequencies. The compact Excite X16 turns every recording into an exemplary sonic performance.

Set-up is particularly simplified: the X24 is exceptionally compact, and includes an integrated base/foot that allows upward angling for improved directivity. It can also be removed to facilitate installations where space is minimal, or may be supplemented by a Dynaudio wall mount bracket.The Excite X24 cabinet features a magnetically-attached front grille and is available in the four standard Excite finishes to offer optimal aesthetic integration into any living space.

The slimline Excite X34 stands less than 95 cm tall and is only 17 cm wide, but its dual MSP mid/woofers, coated soft dome tweeter and special dispersion character serve up unmistakably high-end sound. With its extremely lightweight aluminium voice coils and greater driver membrane radiating area and larger enclosure volume than a compact speaker, it can produce deep, powerful bass even in spacious rooms from its twin 14cm long-throw MSP mid-bass drivers and 28mm tweeter. Precise fine-tuning of the crossover optimises dispersion for incredibly an accurate, three-dimensional presentation of the recording. Just as the artist intended. The X34 is also extremely amplifier-friendly due to its ultra-linear 8 Ohm impedance. The exquisitely finished cabinet includes a cloth grille secured by concealed magnets, and has a  smart base construction: on hardwood floors, the X34 can stand on four resonance-absorbing feet, while four adjustable integrated spikes may be used to achieve a perfect foundation on carpeted surfaces.

It matches best with theEvidence MasterandEvidence Temptationmodels. This is the first center channel speaker where choices of materials, craftsmanship and performance have been lavished at the exalted Evidence level. First-rate film productions and fine multi-channel recordings reach a new dimension through the Dynaudio Evidence. The Evidence Center is perfectly tailored to meet the requirements of modern multi-channel recordings: Dynaudio’s many years of direct involvement with professional recording studios around the world substantiated that in a modern multi-channel system all loudspeakers should be of the same high quality and meet the complex requirements this entails. In the most demanding recordings, the center channel is increasingly put at the heart of the sound stage. Through these requirements it follows that the Evidence Center shares the same construction and design principles as the Evidence Master and Temptation. This is immediately obvious from the solid aluminum baffle of the middle section into which two close-tolerance matched coated soft dome tweeters and two symmetrically arranged mid range drivers featuring Dynaudio’s proprietary MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) speaker cone material are perfectly integrated.

        "opis": "The most refined Evidence model. From its sophisticated design, materials and construction to the advanced acoustic expertise that underpins its sound, every single detail in the Evidence Platinum is designed to deliver an unparalleled musical experience. Before we start, we just want to say this: Evidence isn’t a ‘luxury’ speaker. It doesn’t have gold-plated screws or endangered wood inlays, and it doesn’t make boastful (and meaningless) claims about the ethereal nature of sound. It’s simply the best way to hear your music. Evidence Platinum encompasses all the values and ambitions we had when we started Dynaudio in 1977 – to reproduce music without colouration, effects or distortion, so you can hear it unvarnished: the way it was meant to be heard. Each speaker is handcrafted to near-impossible standards in our factory in Denmark – overseen by experts in furniture polishing, acoustics, materials science (the people who handle the proprietary Magnesium Silicate Polymer material we use for our drivers and the precision-coating we put on our soft-dome tweeters), woodworking, CNC machining and more. And it doesn’t leave us until it’s perfect.  Underpinning the sound is advanced Dynaudio Directivity Control (DDC) – which dramatically reduces the effect your room has on the speakers by up to 75%. It works using precisely positioned dual woofers, midrange drive units – and, of course, our legendary Esotar2 tweeters – all precision-matched in their arrays, and mirrored up the length of the hyper-stable 4cm-thick machined aluminium baffle. Behind the drivers is an advanced crossover design, updated wiring and components and ultra-sophisticated bracing. Even the screws we use are optimised for the concept. The crossover is housed in its own compartment to isolate it from any unwanted vibrations and provide an optimised thermal and mechanical environment for its high-grade components. It’s also ventilated at the back to keep its operating temperature within the super-strict tolerances our engineers have laid out (they like setting themselves challenges like that… and then beating them). Why use four woofers, housed in two separate cabinets? Because they deliver a more even spread of lower frequencies in the room – something you wouldn’t realise with a single, large subwoofer. Not only that, you still get the power of a larger driver, but with it comes the control and precision you can only achieve with smaller drivers. We’ve been perfectingour soft-dome tweetersfor the best part of 40 years – so, as you might imagine, we’ve become pretty good at it. The Esotar2 is the culmination of all that research. Its precision coating means its frequency response can easily top 25,000Hz without distorting, without delivering unwanted resonances, and without letting its transient response waver or compress. And because there’s a lot of airflow in a tweeter (even if it is a really small piece of equipment), we’ve applied aerodynamic principles to its design, too. Its magnet assembly is shaped and damped to absorb as much rear energy as possible – which translates to incredible dynamics and purity. Evidence Platinum: pure craftsmanship; pure music.

As in the Evidence Master, the outstanding DDC technology reduces floor and ceiling reflections to impress with absolutely pure, undistorted and dynamic sound in any living room. Compared to the Master and Platinum models, the Temptation utilizes smaller woofers, thus allowing Evidence sound quality in medium or smaller sized rooms. At the heart of the timeless elegance of the Temptation lies the Evidence technology concept, housed in an alluring slim cabinet. It makes it possible to achieve sonic perfection while offering optimal integration into any living room. Similar to the uncompromising modular construction of the Evidence Master, the bass, mid, and treble drive units as well as the crossover are mechanically isolated from each other in order to perfect every minute detail to realize the highest sonic performance level possible. As the Evidence Temptation is more compact in its overall dimensions, its cabinet does not necessitate three individual sections. Two MSP cone mid range drivers and two soft-dome tweeters are integrated in the middle section which itself is manufactured from solid, CNC-machined aluminum. This material’s attributes together with its specifically rounded sides ensures uniform and uncolored sound dispersion. The completely transparent and relaxed reproduction of the highest frequencies provides an accurate sonic experience. The tweeters’ fine soft domes are each protected by an acoustically neutral slim titanium bar.

        "opis": "The Focus 220 II is a highly developed floor-standing loudspeaker embodying Dynaudio’s passion for music. Like the predecessor Focus 220, this floorstanding loudspeaker relies on two Esotec+ mid/bass drivers with an advanced double magnet system. For the 220 II version, the bass reflex port has been fine-tuned to achieve an even tighter, more precise bass performance.The use of large diameter aluminium voice-coils increases thermal handling capabilities, allowing all drivers to operate within an ideal temperature range, even at high continuous power levels. The MSP cone is manufactured from Magnesium Silicate Polymer – a Dynaudio exclusive and essential to the unique sound quality.Further enhancements in the Focus 220 II crossover ensure a very smooth overall frequency response and an ideal phase response. The incredibly detailed high frequency reproduction is guaranteed by the specially coated Esotec+ soft-dome tweeter. For the Focus 220 II version, the tweeter’s performance has been improved further by fine-tuning the frequency range. Neodymium, one of the most efficient but also most expensive magnetic materials has been used. Combined with the extremely light aluminium voice coil, the high frequency reproduction is remarkably dynamic and clean, but as a result of the special fabric dome coating also extremely smooth and natural. This complete driver assembly is built into a rigid, die-cast aluminium basket. Even the tweeter is firmly secured to the cabinet by using a solid metal face-plate, so any resonance is eliminated.

        "opis": "Only when the sonic balance of all speakers is the same, will there be a true room-filling audio experience. To achieve such an authentic sound balance, the driver technology used for the Focus 200 C Center channel loudspeaker is of the same very high standard as that employed in the Focus floor standing and stand-mount speakers. After all, such sophisticated technology for a center speaker is fully justified if one considers that more than 75 percent of the sound in a multi-channel production is directed to the center channel. Two matching 15 cm mid/bass drivers using Esotec+ technology are employed in the Focus 200 C. These use an optimized double-magnet system so that dynamic impulses can be reproduced precisely and undistorted, even at high volume levels. Impressive sound quality and high power handling capability are achieved through Dynaudio’s characteristically large lightweight aluminium voice-coils and the torsionally stiff, low turbulence die-cast aluminium speaker basket frames. A typical attribute of the MSP cone diaphragms is their freedom of coloration: This keeps voices realistic and open, criteria essential for a high quality center channel.For the Focus 200 C center channel loudspeaker, Dynaudio’s renowned soft-dome tweeter, specially treated with proprietary ferro-fluid to ensure perfect dome behavior, is used for the high frequency reproduction. Both complex sound effects and fine details are easily reproduced yet fit the overall sound character perfectly. The magnetic shielding accommodates the center channel’s preferred positioning near the video display.

        "opis": "For a dynamic power delivery in the bass region, this slim floor-standing loudspeaker relies on two mid/bass drivers from the updated Esotec+ generation. By employing a double-magnet motor system with ultra-compressed Ferrite magnets, dramatic musical passages are reproduced without compromise. And with increased cone excursion, even the most powerful transients are delivered without compression. The use of large diameter aluminium voice-coils has increased thermal handling capabilities tremendously, allowing all drivers to operate within an ideal temperature range, even at high continuous power levels and during powerful music transients. Another Dynaudio exclusive: The cone diaphragm with controlled rigidity is manufactured from Magnesium Silicate Polymer (MSP) – a material essential to the unique Dynaudio sound. This complete motor assembly is built into a torsionally rigid die-cast aluminium basket, which has been optimized to eliminate air turbulence and resonance and the adverse effects of such. The extremely smooth and incredibly detailed high frequency reproduction characteristic of Dynaudio is guaranteed by the T 380 soft-dome tweeter, which features Esotec+ technology. For the upper-range in the Focus 220, this called for the employment of Neodymium – one of the most efficient but also most expensive magnetic materials for loudspeaker construction. With the tweeter’s solid metal face-plate firmly attached to the cabinet by no less than six screws, any resonance is eliminated. Such a secure, neutral foundation is simply not possible by using light-weight plastic cabinets or loosely mounted drivers.

The asymmetrical form of the cabinet takes shape with sidewalls that gently taper towards the back, contributing additional rigidity to the assembly. In principle, this further prevents unwanted resonance and its detrimental effects. The end result is pure and untainted sound reproduction free of coloration. The Esotec+ technology is also prominently featured in the smallest model of the Focus range. The integrated D 280 tweeter with its coated 28mm soft dome fascinates with its incredibly detailed resolution of the high frequencies – a level of performance for which Dynaudio has become renowned.Another element typical of Dynaudio is the diffraction-optimized shape of the new Esotec+ mid/bass driver. Its cone’s characteristic curvature further aids imaging so that even at short listening distances or in a smaller room a realistic, true three-dimensional sound-stage can be enjoyed. In relation to the total cone surface area, the voice-coil is exceptionally large in diameter, allowing a most precise conversion of the amplifier’s signal to music. The result is uncompromised, direct music enjoyment.The Focus 110’s balanced frequency response is not simply the result of the superior drivers utilized, but also a product of accurate fine-tuning of the crossover.

The impressive energy and dynamics are achieved by redeveloped 20 cm woofers, arranged in a dual driver design. The large diaphragm surface and the immense inner volume of the cabinet allows authentic deep bass delivery and reproduction down to 31 Hz. Even the most energetic low frequency notes are reproduced in an absolutely precise and controlled manner, thanks to extraordinarily large voice coils with the magnet inside the coil.The result is remarkable speed and accuracy in the lower registers.

        "opis": "The Focus 140 embodies all of the virtues in Dynaudio’s long-standing tradition of high-performance compact loudspeakers: Highly evolved Dynaudio technology, meticulously selected components, painstakingly matched materials and carefully voiced sonics. Every technical detail is developed and manufactured exclusively by Dynaudio. One example is the sophisticated cross-over designed for the Focus 140, which unifies the speaker drivers to deliver a seamless and homogenous presentation. Air-coils wound with the purest copper, high-grade Solen capacitors and zero temperature drift ceramic resistors provide the absolute purity essential for natural music reproduction. To achieve a seamless transition between bass and treble, Dynaudio cross-overs always feature simple 1st order filters (6dB/octave). These networks deliver a superior transient response, which further improves dynamics with lively music recordings.Passion for detail also leads to perfection in the Esotec+ tweeter.

The Xeo 2s can play anything you stream to them wirelessly via Bluetooth – from any compatible device. They also have on-board physical inputs: digital optical (which can handle 24-bit/192kHz hi-res files), analogue RCA stereo, and analogue 3.5mm minijack. Control them from the supplied remote control, or using the touch-sensitive buttons on top of the cabinet. Hook them up them to aDynaudio Connectbox via the USB and digital coaxial connections and add wireless hi-res streaming up to 24-bit/96kHz, iOS control, multiroom and DLNA support. But it doesn’t end there. We don’t believe you should have to change your room layout to get the sound quality you deserve. That’s why we’ve given the Xeo 2s some of our mostadvanced digital processing technology: these speakers aren’t just well connected, they’re smart too.Mount them on stands; keep them on a shelf; put them in a corner; seat them on the optionalwall-bracketsfor a seamless look. Just tell the Xeo 2s where they are via a rear switch, and they’ll optimise their sound for that position (and for the volume they’re playing at). The Xeo 2’s 28mm tweeter and 14cm mid/bass driver sit in a solid aluminium baffle and ultra-stable composite housing. It’s all designed to minimise unwanted interference – giving the twin 65W amplifiers everything they need to do their work. And you can upgrade them without upgrading them: our R&D engineers can send out future firmware updates to add new features and functions. (They love to tinker.)

        "opis": "Power, control, finesse, convenience. Xeo 30 takes the floor – bringing a fresh look, updated tech, improved tuning and an elevated level of wireless hi-fi performance. As free-standing speakers go, they’re a compact pair – but unleash them and you’ll feel your eyebrows rocket skyward. (Don’t worry, it’s a natural reaction. It happens to us all the time when we visit our listening rooms.) The Xeo 30 replaces the older Xeo 6. But our designers didn’t just want to start from the ground up. They – and you – love those modern classics, which is why they’ve smoothed, softened and refined the look rather than giving it a complete overhaul. Square is out, rounded is in; the metal driver parts are black and sleek; the infra-red control module is effortlessly integrated under the woofers… Take off the smart black grille and you’ll find a 28mm Esotec soft-dome tweeter and twin 14cm Esotec MSP woofers. They all use the same tech that’s made our loudspeakers so celebrated since we started out in 1977: lightweight aluminium voice-coils, innovative magnet systems, proprietary diaphragm materials and more. And each driver’s performance has been brought totally up to date with its own individually tuned, individually optimised 65W amplifier. Under the hood, cutting-edge DSP (digital signal processing) works away to keep those amps performing at their best. Our engineers looked towards our professional studio speakers – theLYD 5s, specifically to hone the technology’s characteristics. And that means they’ve been able to draw a line directly from the performer, through the recording studio, to your living room. You’ll hear only what the artist wanted you to hear when they laid down their tracks. Xeo 30’s updated firmware improves compressor and limiter performance for improved dynamics, along with a simplified 2.5-way crossover. It’s also widened the overlap between the tweeter and woofers’ frequency ranges for incredible integration from top to bottom, as well as giving improved bass and off-axis performance (so now even people out to the sides can enjoy the music just as much as the people on the sofa). We used a similar approach on theFocus XDrange. Simplifying the crossover also gives the DSP engine a chance to rev-up more on speaker-position compensation for improvements in free-standing, against-the-wall and in-the-corner placements. The bass-port design further enhances low-frequency performance too, for even greater weight and punch. The Xeo 30’s master speaker now has direct inputs. There’s 24-bit/192kHz-compatible Toslink digital optical for hi-res sources, as well as stereo RCA phono and 3.5mm minijack inputs for myriad other sources. And, of course, you can stream in wireless 24/96 hi-res from the optional DynaudioConnectbox, which gives you even more input options. Want to go full wireless from your smartphone or other Bluetooth device? There’s built-in high-quality aptX Bluetooth on board for total convenience. We’d say it’s as easy as ‘plug-and-play’, but… well… no plugs. The two speakers (both of which can be set to either left or right channels depending on how you want to set them up) communicate with each other using a full-fat 24-bit/96kHz signal, so you can be sure you’re hearing the smallest of details in your music without having to fret about which cables and interconnects to buy. And because we know you don’t want the hassle of having to get out of your seat in the middle of a great listening session, we’ve even upgraded the remote control. Now it controls the direct inputs as well as the DynaudioConnectbox, and even works over a greater distance.

        "opis": "Compact digital active wireless hi-fi speakers.Forty years of hi-fi expertise – plus cutting-edge digital technology – in a compact stand-mounted speaker. Xeo 20 takes all the things we loved about the older Xeo 4, updates them to things we love even more, and adds a few extra surprises. You’ll have already noticed the facelift. Our designers have rounded the corners and softened the edges. They’ve moved the infra-red receiver from the top to under the woofer for a neater, cleaner look. And they’ve made the metal driver parts black for a touch of Nordic simplicity. If you were to take the speaker apart (although we’d really rather you didn’t), you’d see just as many developments inside, too. The 14cm Esotec MSP driver and 28mm Esotec soft-dome tweeter (both packed with legendary Dynaudio tech, includingaluminiumvoice-coils and innovative magnet systems) are each powered by their own 65W digital amplifiers. And because one size doesn’t always fit all, each amp is precisely tuned andoptimizedfor the driver it’s powering – giving our engineers incredible control over their performance. That control comes from the best. Xeo 20’s tuning is based on our celebratedLYD 5professional studio monitors – speakers that work at the front line of music production. It gives you a direct line from performer to mixing desk to living room… what they heard is what you get. The updated firmware includes improved compressor and limiter algorithms and a simplified crossover. That means a larger overlap between the drivers’ frequency ranges for incredible integration, improved bass and much better off-axis performance… so if you’re jostled out of the good seat, you know you’ll still have a great time. We’ve also given the DSP (digital signal processing) engine more horsepower, as well as simplifying it, to enhance speaker-position compensation for corner, wall and free-space placements. It’s a similar approach to the one we used for theFocus XDrange. A slot-type bass port, meanwhile, handles the moving-air stage to further improve, tighten and enhance low-frequency performance. Xeo 20 also gets direct inputs, so you don’t need to add any external boxes to plug in your existing equipment – although if you want even more options, including wireless 24-bit/96kHz hi-res audio, the optional DynaudioConnectbox has you covered. Round the back of the master speaker (which can be set as either the left or right channel) you’ll find 24-bit/192kHz Toslink digital optical, stereo RCA phono and 3.5mm minijack inputs for all your sources. So, yes, you can still plug in that old cassette player or 8-track machine… Don’t want to use wires? We’ve added built-in aptX Bluetooth so you can stream wirelessly from any compatible device. And because the Xeo 20 speakers communicate together using a full-fat 24/96 hi-res signal, you know you won’t miss a single detail in your music. If you don’t want to get out of your seat (we totally understand), you’ll also be happy to hear that the updated remote control works with Xeo 20’s direct inputs and the Dynaudio Connect box – and over a longer distance than before. Xeo 20 is designed to work with the optionalStand 10andStand 20, and there’s also built-in provision for Vesa 100 mounts.

        "opis": "The optimum wireless floor standing loudspeaker with genuine high-end sound quality. A slimline floor standing speaker with built-in amplifier and no speaker cables delivering high-end sound quality – previosly inconceivable before the Xeo 5. As with the compact Xeo 3, the innovative Dynaudio speaker technology is featured, but in the Xeo 5 dual mid/ bass drivers and a larger cabinet volume are utilized. In concert with the high-performance digital amplifier, an incredibly deep bass response is achieved, allowing the Xeo 5 to perform magnificently even in larger spaces. These technologies unite with the advanced Dynaudio soft dome tweeters in the Xeo 5 to deliver a perfectly balanced and incredibly dynamic reproduction of music that remains powerful yet rich in clarity and detail. You’ll be impressed by the voluminous, the full sound and intensity of every note, even when enjoying live performances. A pair of Xeo 5s flanking the flat screen TV outperforms the sound of any built-in speaker or sound bar, and provides the feeling of a home cinema – even without a subwoofer. Normally this sound quality is only reserved for a meticulously configured hi-fi system – but the Xeo 5 already has the ideal amplifier built in, and what’s more, it’s wireless!

        "opis": "Wireless active hi-fi speakers for smaller spaces. Immense audio from a bookshelf speaker. Xeo 10 packs decades of Dynaudio performance into our most compact speakers ever. Xeo 10 wireless active hi-fi speaker proves that ‘versatility’ needn’t mean ‘compromise’. Put it on a shelf. On your desk. On stands. Wherever and however you use it, you’re guaranteed all the performance you’d expect from 45 years of audio expertise. Xeo 10 updates and improves the outgoing Xeo 2 model with updated components, improved tunings and fresh finishes… even updated packaging. Make no mistake, this is far more than just a fresh look. If you place the Xeo 10 next to an older Xeo 2, the first thing you’ll notice is the smoother, sleeker design. We’ve mounted the driver to the baffle from behind – meaning no more visible screws, and given the solid aluminium front baffle a brushed finish. The Xeo 10 is available in Black Satin (with a black baffle and grille) or White Satin (with a grey baffle and grille) finishes. Inside the super-rigid composite cabinet you’ll find an original, optimised 14cm MSP woofer and one of our signature 28mm soft-dome tweeters (a technology we’ve been using since the very beginning, and which has appeared in every single high-end speaker we’ve ever produced). And since this is an active speaker, each driver has its own dedicated 65W digital amplifier. That not only means we can fine-tune each amp specifically for the driver it’s powering, it means we have even greater control over the speaker’s overall performance. (For more information on active vs passive speakers, click here.) The Xeo 10 has an updated tuning with improved limiter algorithms for better high-volume performance, as well as a higher theoreticalcrossoverpoint – which means the tweeter can reach deeper in its frequency range for a bigger overlap with the woofer’s upper limit. Want a translation? It means a far smoother balance between bass and treble, and also improved off-axis performance – so if even if you’ve been muscled out of the the ‘sweet spot’ by your jealous friends, you can still get the full benefit of your music. Of course, you still get everything that made the Xeo 2 an award-winner: direct inputs, touch-sensitive volume controls, and position-sensitive controls (tell the speakers if they’re in free space, against a wall or in a corner and they’ll adjust their performance accordingly). That’s not to mention full-fat, true hi-res 24-bit/96kHz performance and compatibility with the optional Dynaudio Connect box (which gives you even more inputs, DLNA, multi-room audio and more). And to top it off, it’s specifically designed to work with the optional Dynaudio desk stand and dedicated wall-mount, as well as Vesa 100 mountings, for massive flexibility in placement. See? It’s more than just a pretty face. We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

It adapts seamlessly (and automatically) to any room or position, and to surrounding noise levels – so your music always sounds its best. Access your music from any Bluetooth, Apple AirPlay or DLNA source. Tune in to a world's worth of internet radio. Just push play. The intelligent wireless music system that automatically adapts to your room and your lifestyle. Music 5 uses two 1in tweeters, twin 3in midrange drivers and a single 5in woofer. It’s mains-powered, and also has a digital optical input and a remote control. It uses all the same core technologies – Magnesium Silicate Polymer woofers and midrange drivers, soft-dome tweeters and measurements from our world-class Dynaudio Labs facility – that have made our in-home, in-car and pro-studio speakers so legendary. Like the rest of the Music family, it uses cutting-edge digital processing to sense where it's been placed. It optimises its performance to fit (even when you move it) and adjusts itself on the fly for varying noise-levels, so your music sounds clear at any volume. Connect it to your phone, your CD player, your TV… listen however you want.

        "opis": "More black. More beauty. The Contour S 3.4 LE delivers a natural, balanced yet dynamic sound due to its special cabinet construction, advanced loudspeaker technology and incredibly refined sound tuning. The Contour S 3.4 LE is available in natural oiled Walnut, Bubinga piano lacquer, Mocca piano lacquer and Black piano lacquer. The die-cast aluminum woofer baskets are finished in matte black while the metal front baffle is finished in satin black. The high-gloss Black piano lacquer version of the Contour LE features a metal front baffle finished in stainless steel which makes a beautiful contrast to the black cabinet. Yet beauty is not only skin-deep. The Contour LE has been technically refined and upgraded as well. The Dynaudio soft dome tweeter with Precision Coating provides fine, detailed high frequency reproduction; while the internal wiring uses high-quality OFC copper cable. The crossover has been further refined with special ceramic resistors and high quality capacitors, providing an exceptionally pure and incredibly refined music reproduction. The Contour woofers utilize the most sophisticated Dynaudio technologies such as MSP cones, extremely lightweight aluminium wire voice coils on Kapton formers and rigid, low resonance die-cast aluminium baskets. One of the most distinctive aspects of the Contour is its construction: The extremely rigid cabinet features a unique baffle assembly. It consists of three layers, including a layer of damping material, and a thick metal front plate. This construction effectively reduces cabinet resonance and allows excellent sonic performance - even at the highest volume levels. The drive units are positioned on the baffle with the tweeter below the dual woofers to achieve ideal time alignment at the listening position. The Contour S 3.4 LE combines the very best of Dynaudio: The finest cabinet finishes handcrafted in Denmark, an elegant and slim loudspeaker cabinet design, advanced Dynaudio driver technology, and the renowned, refined and balanced Dynaudio sound quality. The Contour Limited Edition models are available in a choice of three real-wood veneer finishes: natural oiled Walnut, Bubinga or Mocca with transparent piano lacquer with a satin black baffle, or in Black piano lacquer finish with a stainless steel baffle.

The Contour Cabinet is strengthened by cross braces in specific areas to achieve a solid, vibration-free construction. Internally, the MDF walls are damped with an extremely dense material that absorbs even the most microscopic resonance.In conjunction with the advanced metal baffle construction, an extremely stiff and rigid unit is created, further ennobled by the finely polished surface of a beautifully finished real wood veneer. The innovative base plinth, derived from the Dynaudio Confidence range, serves as a stylish yet solid stand for the speakers. The crossover is mounted on a smaller block, between the plinth and the cabinet, away from unwanted vibrations and resonance, while using the shortest possible path-lengths to the gold plated WBT terminals. The sensitive components are thus isolated from any potential performance compromising factors. In the S 3.4, the Esotec tweeter is used; it features a double magnet system that ensures extremely high power handling and precise control of movement of the dome.

        "opis": "This special center speaker drew upon Dynaudio's extensive experience in developing professional studio loudspeaker technology focused on the requirements of modern multi-channel recordings: Every loudspeaker in a multi-channel system requires the same character and level of sound quality - any variances between the speakers is unacceptable to Dynaudio. With more high-resolution multi-channel digital formats than ever, the center channel has taken on an increasingly important role. The Contour S CX utilizes extremely dynamic mid/bass drivers featuring solid aluminium voice coils to offer incredibly high power handling and remarkable low-frequency performance, even in large sized rooms. The drivers are integrated onto the massive, damped metal front baffle for absolute resonance control in the relatively large cabinet. The Contour S CX incorporates the advanced Esotar² soft dome tweeter to reproduce the high frequencies, achieving the highest resolution and purest, most homogenous response as recognized from the Contour S 5.4 model from which this tweeter was derived. The Contour S CX is available in a choice of real-wood veneer finishes: Maple, Cherry, Rosewood and Black Ash.

The real wood veneer is meticulously polished by hand to yield a silky smooth finish, an elegant contrast to the solid aluminum and metal elements so essential to the advanced technology of the loudspeakers. To allow for the S 1.4 to achieve its highest potential, the optional Stand4 is recommended.

        "opis": "More refinement. More design. The Contour S 1.4 LE sounds much more substantial than its size might suggest, yet provides a high level of refinement and sound balance. The S 1.4 LE is available in Bubinga piano lacquer, oiled Walnut, Mocca piano lacquer and Black piano lacquer. The die-cast aluminum woofer baskets are finished in matte black while the metal front baffle is finished in satin black. The high-gloss black piano lacquer version of the Contour LE has a metal front made of stainless steel which offers a beautiful contrast to the gloss black cabinet. Yet beauty is more than skin-deep. The Contour LE has been technically refined and further upgraded as well. The Dynaudio soft dome tweeter with Precision Coating provides fine, detailed high frequencies; while the internal wiring uses high-quality OFC copper cable. The crossover has been further refined by using special ceramic resistors and high quality capacitors, providing an exceptionally pure and refined music reproduction. The Contour woofers include the best Dynaudio technology such as MSP cones, extremely light aluminium wire voice coils on Kapton formers and rigid, low resonance die-cast aluminium baskets. One of the most distinct part of the Contour is it construction: The extremely stiff cabinet features a unique baffle. It consists of three layers, including a layer of damping material, and a thick metal plate. This construction effectively reduces cabinet resonance and allows excellent sound performance up to the highest volume levels. On this baffle the tweeter is positioned below the woofers to achieve ideal time alignment at the listening position. For the best sound experience in the room Dynaudio suggests the dedicated Stand 6 with the additional S1.4 top plate. The Stand 6 provides a solid, low-resonance foundation and perfectly matches the design and size of the Contour cabinet. The Contour S 1.4 combines the best of Dynaudio: The finest cabinet finishes handmade in Denmark, an elegant and slim loudspeaker cabinet design, advanced Dynaudio driver technology, and the renowned, refined and balanced Dynaudio sound quality. The Contour LE models are available in a choice of three real-wood veneer finishes - natural oiled Walnut, and Bubinga or Mocca piano gloss lacquer - as well as in Black piano lacquer with a stainless steel baffle.

The Hub features three digital inputs:Optical, coaxial, and USB. All digital inputs are high-res ready and support up to 24 bit/96 kHz, so you can play your high-res audio files. It also features two analogue inputs:A stereo mini jack for connecting a smartphone, tablet or any other personal media devices, as well as a set of RCA stereo inputs allowing connection to an existing hi-fi system or any other analogue sources. Depending on room shapes and wall construction, the Hub can send the wireless signal up to 20 meters, or even more depending upon walls and other boundaries. The Multi-room function also allows multiple Xeo speakers to receive the signal from one single Hub. And the best thing:The Hub requires no software and no installation, as it instantly sets up its own wireless connection to the Xeo speakers via the selectable 2.4 GHz, 5.2 GHz, or 5.8 GHz frequencies.

        "opis": "The next generation of floor-standing high-end loudspeakers. No amplifier. No speaker cables. No compromise. These compact 450W floorstanders use ourproprietary MSP woofers and precision-coated soft-dome tweeters, just like their bigger brothers, the Focus 60 XDs. Their tri-amp configuration and intelligent digital amplifiers means each driver gets exactly the right amount of the right frequencies, at the right time, to help your music sound exactly as it should. The Focus XD range is a complete hi-fi system… without the clutter of a complete hi-fi system. These high-end active speakers bring true high-resolution wireless streaming, from every conceivable source, to your home. Send in a digital signal (wired or wireless, it’s your choice), and it’ll stay that way right up until the last possible moment – meaning it stays pure all the way from the recording studio to the speaker driver. There’s no clutter, no fuss… and no catch. Running the show iscutting-edge digital processing technologycapable of handling full-fat, 24-bit/192kHz hi-res files. All the speakers in the range share common controls and connections – so if you want to mix-and-match different models from the range, you can. There’s digital coaxial in and out, plus analogue input (with adjustable sensitivity), as well as a seven-position control for fine-tuning the speakers’ placement in your room. And if you add theDynaudio Connect box, you get digital optical, another digital coaxial and RCA and 3.5mm analogue inputs – plus mini-USB (which can stream 24-bit/96kHz files), aptX Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity (including DLNA). The Focus XD’sfirmware can even be upgradedwhen our engineers have another Eureka! moment (they get them a lot). In fact, that’s exactly what’s just happened. In the 2017 version, not only have theyredesigned the crossoversand found a way to use less processing (for even cleaner reproduction), they’ve managed to extract more volume from the drivers without distortion or compression. And because there’s less processing happening there, we’ve been able to use more in the EQ for even better speaker-position compensation. We’ve also included tech from our LYD pro-studio monitors that lets you tweak overall brightness with a switch on the back. Use them with your existing system (they’ll integrate just fine), build a multiroom set-up (you can use them with the Xeo range too), or even hook them up to your TV… while getting genuine high-end wireless hi-fi into the bargain.

        "opis": "The next generation of floor-standing high-end loudspeakers. The Focus 400 XD combines the best of two worlds: The sleek elegance of a relatively compact floor-standing loudspeaker with the astonishing sonic performance of 450 watts of completely optimized amplification. The Focus 400 XD offers the best of two worlds: the sleek elegance of a compact floor-standing loudspeaker design, with an extreme level of un-compromised performance and sheer output capability that was previously unfathomable for a speaker with such a modest footprint. The Focus 400 XD is equipped with the same feature set as the 200 XD model, and boasts an additional Esotec+ woofer and another 150W of amplifier power along with its additional cabinet volume. Aside from the sophisticated digital amplifier and the proprietary Esotec+ driver technology, the 400 XD is distinguished by its exceptional sound quality: the optimized phase and crossover tuning of the drivers in the Focus XD models allows audio reproduction at such a high level of precision and accuracy that a fascinatingly three-dimensional playback is achieved. Both bass and high frequency reproduction can be precisely adjusted to the specific room acoustics for the highest level of audio playback quality. The Focus XD models feature magnetically attached grilles and are available in a choice of four premium finishes (Walnut, Rosewood, Satin White, or Satin Black). A discreetly integrated LED display indicates volume and input selection. The floor standing models feature outrigger feet equipped with both non-slip resonance absorbers as well as integrated adjustable spikes that can be exposed, perfectly complementing the speakers' elegant design. Thus not only the sound but also the physical placement of the 400 XD can be perfectly adapted to the room. A compact floor-standing active loudspeaker with wireless capability featuring 450W of high-end amplifier power per channel, the Focus 400 XD is another statement model offering a most impressive sound quality that will make true music lovers sit up and take notice.

Each Focus 200 XD incorporates a 300 watt digital amplifier, perfectly optimized to the high-performance woofer and tweeter, allowing them to reproduce sound at the finest level possible. One will be amazed at the sheer volume, depth and power that this little loudspeaker can put out. Crafting benchmark-setting high-end compact loudspeakers has become a tradition at Dynaudio; with their exceptionally dynamic, balanced, and bold sound, the Focus 200 XD will set a higher standard. The latest chapter in this story is digital, active, and high-resolution. And with the Focus XD model range offering the option of wireless connectivity, uncompromised high-end sound quality has never been more convenient. The Speaker Position EQ control of the Dynaudio Focus XD models allows their bass performance to be optimized relative to their placement, be it positioned near a wall boundary, in a corner, or free-standing, allowing the speakers to be perfectly integrated into any room. The Dynaudio Stand 6 loudspeaker stands, which feature a sound-optimizing anti-resonance construction and integrated cable management, serve as the ideal companion to facilitate use of the 200 XD as a freestanding high-end monitor. Lastly, the Focus 200 XD comes with a remote control that allows you to choose between different inputs, raise or lower the volume, power the Focus 200 XD on and off, and mute the speaker We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "The next generation of stand-mounted high-end loudspeakers. No amplifier. No speaker cables. No compromise. Dynaudio has spent decades repeatedly redefining the compact loudspeaker – and with the 300W Focus 20 XD, it’s happened again. The MSP driver and 28mm tweeter from the rest of the Focus XD range appear here, too – along with all the authority and control of the larger speakers. It’s quality, concentrated.  The Focus XD range is a complete hi-fi system… without the clutter of a complete hi-fi system. These high-end active speakers bring true high-resolution wireless streaming, from every conceivable source, to your home. Send in a digital signal (wired or wireless, it’s your choice), and it’ll stay that way right up until the last possible moment – meaning it stays pure all the way from the recording studio to the speaker driver. There’s no clutter, no fuss… and no catch. Running the show iscutting-edge digital processing technologycapable of handling full-fat, 24-bit/192kHz hi-res files. All the speakers in the range share common controls and connections – so if you want to mix-and-match different models from the range, you can. There’s digital coaxial in and out, plus analogue input (with adjustable sensitivity), as well as a seven-position control for fine-tuning the speakers’ placement in your room. And if you add theDynaudio Connect box, you get digital optical, another digital coaxial and RCA and 3.5mm analogue inputs – plus mini-USB (which can stream 24-bit/96kHz files), aptX Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity (including DLNA). The Focus XD’sfirmware can even be upgradedwhen our engineers have another Eureka! moment (they get them a lot). In fact, that’s exactly what’s just happened. In the 2017 version, not only have theyredesigned the crossoversand found a way to use less processing (for even cleaner reproduction), they’ve managed to extract more volume from the drivers without distortion or compression. And because there’s less processing happening there, we’ve been able to use more in the EQ for even better speaker-position compensation. We’ve also included tech from our LYD pro-studio monitors that lets you tweak overall brightness with a switch on the back. Use them with your existing system (they’ll integrate just fine), build a multiroom set-up (you can use them with the Xeo range too), or even hook them up to your TV… while getting genuine high-end wireless hi-fi into the bargain.

        "opis": "Raising the standard for active high-end loudspeakers. The Focus 60 XD is for those seeking the best possible audio performance and completely uncompromised sound quality. The 600W floorstanding Focus 60 XDs are the ultimate union of quality, power and performance. With twin long-throw 18cm woofers and a dedicated 14cm midrange driver – both made from our proprietary MSP material – plus our legendary 28mm soft-dome tweeter, they’re designed just as much for finesse as they are outright thump. The Focus XD range is a complete hi-fi system… without the clutter of a complete hi-fi system. These high-end active speakers bring true high-resolution wireless streaming, from every conceivable source, to your home. Send in a digital signal (wired or wireless, it’s your choice), and it’ll stay that way right up until the last possible moment – meaning it stays pure all the way from the recording studio to the speaker driver. There’s no clutter, no fuss… and no catch. Running the show iscutting-edge digital processing technologycapable of handling full-fat, 24-bit/192kHz hi-res files. All the speakers in the range share common controls and connections – so if you want to mix-and-match different models from the range, you can. There’s digital coaxial in and out, plus analogue input (with adjustable sensitivity), as well as a seven-position control for fine-tuning the speakers’ placement in your room. And if you add theDynaudio Connect box, you get digital optical, another digital coaxial and RCA and 3.5mm analogue inputs – plus mini-USB (which can stream 24-bit/96kHz files), aptX Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity (including DLNA). The Focus XD’sfirmware can even be upgradedwhen our engineers have another Eureka! moment (they get them a lot). In fact, that’s exactly what’s just happened. In the 2017 version, not only have theyredesigned the crossoversand found a way to use less processing (for even cleaner reproduction), they’ve managed to extract more volume from the drivers without distortion or compression. And because there’s less processing happening there, we’ve been able to use more in the EQ for even better speaker-position compensation. We’ve also included tech from our LYD pro-studio monitors that lets you tweak overall brightness with a switch on the back. Use them with your existing system (they’ll integrate just fine), build a multiroom set-up (you can use them with the Xeo range too), or even hook them up to your TV… while getting genuine high-end wireless hi-fi into the bargain. We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "Raising the standard for active high-end loudspeakers. The Focus 600 XD is the flagship Focus XD model and sets the definitive performance standard for high-end digital active loudspeakers. The Focus 600 XD redefines the high-end loudspeaker and high-end audio system: the perfect combination of a full-size floor-standing loudspeaker and high-performance digital amplification. The Focus 600 XD redefines the high-end loudspeaker and high-end audio system: the perfect combination of a full-size floor-standing loudspeaker and high-performance digital amplification. Both of the redeveloped Focus XD ultra-long-throw Esotec+ woofers feature extremely large and powerful magnets, and each is driven by its own individual 150W power amplifier to ensure that an impressive low frequency output (to 20 Hz) is always delivered at the highest level of precision and accuracy. The proprietary MSP driver cone material, together with the renowned soft dome tweeter with precision coating, ensures the tonal perfection and balanced sound that is characteristic of Dynaudio. The Esotec+ midrange driver and tweeter in the Focus 600 XD are also each individually driven by a high-performance 150W power amplifier, and the four drivers are perfectly harmonized through the highly sophisticated, state-of-the-art DSP. With a combined power output of 600W per speaker, the 600 XD offers a performance reserve allowing it to realistically reproduce the most demanding large orchestral performances, to faithfully recreate the feeling of a live recording, or to deliver the full impact, energy and depth of modern electronica music. The Focus 600 XDs are easily integrated into any room, regardless of its size or the scale of your music: Using the Focus XD Speaker Position EQ, the bass response can be tailored to the particular room acoustics relative to the speakers' placement in the room. Retractable spikes integrated within the aluminum outrigger feet ensure that the speakers can be safely positioned on any floor surface while minimizing resonance. Featuring the same features of the other Focus XD models, the 600 XD includes both analogue and digital inputs, is able to be operated via remote control, can be expanded to deliver wireless and or multi-room playback, and features upgradeable firmware. Digital. Active. Un-compromised. The benchmark for high-end active loudspeakers has taken a quantum leap. Lastly, the Focus 600 XD comes with a remote control that allows you to choose between different inputs, raise or lower the volume, power the Focus 600 XD on and off, and mute the speakers.

Two extra-large 20 cm woofers featuring ultra-rigid die-cast aluminum baskets operate in tandem in a large cabinet volume to guarantee the utmost deep bass extension and low frequency performance. Especially in larger rooms, a precise balance between high, mid and low frequency ranges is imperative – and the Focus 380 is ideally suited for this task. The mid/woofer and woofer cones utilize the proprietary MSP material in order to achieve a seamless sonic integration, while Dynaudio’s finest soft dome tweeter design is employed to reproduce the high frequencies: The Esotar². The overall musical performance is stunning: The Focus 380 is rich in detail, high in resolution but smooth in the high frequencies; open and precise in the midrange, and powerful and absolutely rock-solid in the bass and low bass registers: a loudspeaker for every room and any style of music. The Focus 380 is available in a choice of four real-wood veneer finishes: Maple, Walnut, Rosewood and Black Ash, as well as in White piano and Black piano gloss lacquer finishes.

The Focus 210 C center channel loudspeaker is thus equipped with the same high-quality Dynaudio soft dome tweeters and MSP mid/bass drivers in order to ideally complement the Focus models. Thus the same high level of sound quality as the main left/right channel loudspeakers is maintained to create an evenly balanced, accurately realistic and audibly cohesive soundstage across the video screen. The Focus 210 C crossover and cabinet quality is also built to the same high standards – as this is critically important to achieve a neutral, detailed and natural reproduction of the midrange. Dual mid/bass drivers are employed in parallel to attain an accurate roll-off in the bass. The Focus 210 C thus not only exhibits an excellent midrange quality for reproducing voices naturally, but remains precisely balanced even in the upper and lower bass registers. For a slightly angled directional placement, for example when positioned on a sideboard or on shelving above or below a video monitor, the optional Dynaudio Center Base and Center Base2 angled center channel plinths are available. The Focus 210C is available in a choice of four real-wood veneer finishes: Maple, Walnut, Rosewood and Black Ash, as well as in White piano and Black piano gloss lacquer finishes.

The 52 not only improved on the high performance standard of the model 50 through several driver and cabinet enhancements, it set a new benchmark for compact audio loudspeakers in its class. The Audience 52 cabinet is internally lined with bitumen to eliminate coloration and the effects of resonance, while its class-leading drivers are integrated into a resonance-absorbing MDF baffle. The 17cm MSP mid/woofer is driven by Dynaudio's 75mm aluminum voice-coil, and its advanced 28mm soft-dome tweeter also employs an ultra-light aluminum coil. With its advanced performance capabilities and relatively compact dimensions, the Audience 52 delivers a clean, precise and dynamic sound - in music or home theater system applications - with a powerful presentation that will impress even in large rooms.

The 122C renders both music and movie dialogue with accurate precision and unmatched clarity and dynamics. It is also magnetically shielded to ensure that video performance will not be affected. Extreme attention was taken to ensure the 122C's ability to attain accurately controlled dispersion with proper height and depth to the soundstage. The net result is the speaker's ability to reproduce a widened listening area that affords excellent sound quality to all viewers, regardless of where they are seated within the room.

By incorporating either of these units into your loudspeaker set-up you can extend your bass response to the lowest realms imaginable without compromising the unlimited dynamic range and natural, powerful low frequency reproduction that have always been a part of the Dynaudio experience. The Audience SUB 20A and SUB 30A are actively powered by hand-built amplifiers to increase efficiency and improve output levels while still maintaining excellent sonic performance. When used in a stereo set-up, sub woofers not only improve the low frequency response and volume of the main speakers, but also extend their life-span by taking some of the stress away from their drivers. However, it is the home theatre environment that really benefits from all that additional bass, which is why Dynaudio has introduced the Utility Link - unique device that makes it possible to combine two or more woofers in a multi-channel audio system.

        "opis": "The difference between Audience 7 and your garden-varity home theater loudspeaker is akin to that between a red performance car and a pushbike. The tweeter – from the D-28 family, otherwise at home in some of the most esoteric high end creations – leaves the competition standing at the starting line. With an accleration of several thousand g, a peak power handling of over 1,000 watts and a mass of only 0,5 gram for the dome. Where others in the field go off track at the first sharp acoustic curve, the Audience 7 with its 3\" magnum voice coil in the woofer stays on course. With no oversteering. And where others lose control – on the inside sound straight at the cutting edge of technology – you can have utter confidence in your Audience 7. And this goes not for painstakingly, by hand, and check our speakers 86 times before they´´e allowed on the track. Which means our extraordinary Audience 7 will keep its pace for many a season. Although we did not use carbon fiber for the body. Instead, in consideration of your budget, we employed traditional wood and aerodynamic vinyl. Which means you can afford the Audience 7 even as a rookie – and still drive acoustic circles around much of our so-called competition. Because the driveability of the Audience 7 is unmatched at its size. For both home theater surround applications and \"reals\" hi-fi. How about a pit stop at your dealer?

The 72SE is otherwise a completely original loudspeaker design crafted of the finest components sourced from Dynaudio's state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. The Audience 72SE receives the ESOTEC tweeter, originally developed for the Dynaudio Contour S series models, which features a powerful magnet system with a multiple-coated fabric soft dome and an ultra-light aluminium wire voice coil. Both mid/bass drivers were updated from the standard model 72 as well.  The same powerful high-performance units from Dynaudio's venerable Contour 1.8MkII, with their characteristic MSP (Magnesium-Silicate-Polymer) one-piece cones, large (75 mm) diameter lightweight aluminium wire voice coils and powerful centered magnet systems integrated into extremely rigid, die-cast aluminium frame baskets are used in the Audience 72SE. An improved crossover design ensures a harmonious synergy between the tweeter and mid/bass drivers in the Audience 72SE. High quality components are used throughout to further ensure an optimised performance and integration between the drivers. The meticulously crafted cabinet is constructed with rigid internal bracing and layers of damping material, as one would have come to expect of a Dynaudio design.

        "opis": "Do you want the kind of gut-wrenching bottom end makes home theatre truly come alive? By incorporating either of these units into your loudspeaker set-up you can extend your bass response to the lowest realms imaginable without compromising the unlimited dynamic range and natural, powerful low frequency reproduction that have always been a part of the Dynaudio experience. The Audience SUB-20 A and SUB-30 A are actively powered by hand-built amplifiers to increase efficiency and improve output levels while still maintaining excellent sonic performance. When used in a stereo set-up, sub woofers not only improve the low frequency response and volume of the main speakers, but also extend their life-span by taking some of the stress away from their drivers. However, it is the home theatre environment that really benefits from all that additional bass, which is why Dynaudio has introduced the Utility Link - unique device that makes it possible to combine two or more woofers in a multi-channel audio system.

Ideal for mid to large sized rooms, the 82 has enough authority and power on reserve to effortlessly reproduce the most demanding musical passages or movie soundtracks. Despite its seemingly endless power capabilities, the Audience 82 renders a perfectly balanced sound, detailed and refined, due in large part to the advanced drivers developed specifically for this model. Dual 20cm woofers, and a 15cm midwoofer - each housed in a separate chamber - feature the proprietary MSP cone diaphragms and powerful magnet systems driving lightweight aluminum voice coils to deliver perfect control and incredible dynamics. The extremely rigid die-cast baskets and resonance absorbing MDF cabinet construction allow the driver technology to perform at its highest level, ensuring the most precise and controlled movements of the cone and minimized coloration. The soft dome tweeter delivers an ultra-dynamic linear response that enables it to reproduce even the most dynamic signals without compression. This level of technology is typically reserved for products costing two to three times the price of the Audience 82, making it an incredible value in any regard.

When they are finished, after a few days, I listen to every single one. Some people may think that's a little over the top. That's all right with me; they don't have to buy our products.\" Hugo Nielssen, Dynaudio master-craftman for fifteen years. The idea behind Dynaudio's legendary quality is really quite simple: It's better to avoid mistakes than to correct them once they have occured. This is why the Contour 1.8 is not an impressive combination of the fashionable ideas of the moment. Instead, it is the impressive result of careful detail development. Bass driver and tweeter have been painstakingly developed and aligned, with all the proven elements of Dynaudio's philosophy: The bass driver with oversized aluminium voice coil, linear group delay membrane geometry and exactly defined inner damping - free of coloration or false aggressiveness. A newly developed 8\" bass driver, with a 3\" voice coil, guarantees excellent low frequency dynamics, with a harmonious crossover to the tweeter. The passive Dynaudio BLR system, which reinforces the lowest frequencies in a precise and powerful manner. The fabric dome tweeter, whose naturalness and dynamics are unequalled. The first-order crossover (with special coils and polypropylane capacitors,) which, contrary to higher-order cross-overs, does not suffer from ringing and overshooting. The perfect control over the entire manufacturing process; all parts are meticulously built in-house an then rigorously selected and checked, through measurements and listening. And the beauty of our enclosures - designed by computer, but built by hand. Perfect resonance damping means they have practically no influence on the sound. In the classic floor-standing speaker, all these features combine to form a very musical whole: A homogenous, uncolored sound which sets an impressive new standard for all kinds of music. Its analytical properties make the Contour 1.8 the ideal tool for those who don't just want to improve their system. It's for those who want to gain new musical insights.

        "opis": "'Sure, we could make our spakers cheaper. But we don't want to.' \"We have more quality controls than many speakers from other companies have parts. This may mean that we build relatively few speakers and that their price is relatively high. We still think they're more than worth the money.\" Allan Jensen, Dynaudio vice-president of finance for six years. The incredible transparency and breathtaking spaciousness of the Contour 2.8's sound are the result of thorough development, with careful consideration of the most minute details. As with all models of our new Contour series, the 2.8 features a linearised impedance, which makes the amplifier work easier, and a corrected phase response, to eliminate diffuseness. During manufacture, our fearsome testers will check its true quality and reproduction no less than 86 times. A newly developed 8\" bass driver, with a 3\" voice coil, guarantees excellent low frequency dynamics, with a harmonious crossover to the tweeter. The tweeter is a variant of the legendary Esotar T-330 D (90% of all manufacturers have to buy in their tweeters; we develop and build our own). It's at the very limit of technological feasibility, and its sound is incredibly clean and sparkling. Of course, all this would mean nothing without the Dynaudio crossover with its carefully selected components, such as special coils and polyproylene capacitors, and the enclosure, carefully hand-built, with reinforcement and resonance damping of all crucial parts. One of the best floor-mounted loudspeakers available today, the Contour 2.8 will offer maximum musical pleasure to the ardent music lover, for years and years to come. It will let you appreciate the finest qualities of the best amplifiers, record players and digital sources.

        "opis": "The Dynaudio Contour 1.3 SE (Special Edition) continues the long tradition of excellence established by the Dynaudio Contour Loudspeaker series. After achieving great success with the Contour 1.3 model during the course of the previous 5 years, the engineers at Dynaudio have further engineered and upgraded the standard model in every way, except the enclosure. The result of which is the Contour 1.3 SE. This special model adds a new dimension to the world of compact monitors, and completes the entire range of Dynaudio loudspeakers. The Dynaudio Contour 1.3 SE (Special Edition) continues the long tradition of excellence established by Dynaudio Contour loudspeaker series. Back in 1986, the first Contour models, the Contour 1 and the Contour 2, were launched to the delight of music lovers. Progressive engineering, solid manufacture and timeless design were the foundation of high performance and enduring quality, which has ensured the great success of the Contour models through today.  At the beginning of the 1990's, the engineers at Dynaudio created a product out of a develop project - the Special One. This was a Contour 1 which had integrated every latest technological advance possible in manufacturing technique and component quality, with the objective of creating a product with no compromises, accepted in materials, build or audible performance. Originally it was planned as a limited edition, but throughout the years, over 5,000 of these loudspeakers were sold, despite a price which may have seemed high for such a physically small loudspeaker. Still today, a lot of Special Ones are providing uncompromised listening pleasure to their owners. In 1993, the Contour 1 was discontinued and replaced by the Contour 1.3, later to be updated to the MK II version in 1998. After achieving great success with the Contour 1.3 model during the course of the previous 5 years, the engineers at Dynaudio have upgraded the standard model by further devices, the result of which is the Contour 1.3 SE (Special Edition). The Dynaudio Contour 1.3 SE incorporates much more than just small modifications and tweaks, as so often usual in the High-End area. It is an entirely new loudspeaker built into the cabinet of the Contour 1.3 Mk II. Maximum musical balance, harmonic \"rightness\", and absolute precision were the ultimate objectives of this special project. Since Dynaudio is deep in its resources regarding advanced and specialized driver designs, producing the unique and high performance drivers for this speaker project is aptly accomplished.  The Contour 1.3 SE utilizes specifically engineered and produced drivers. The front plates of the drivers and the rear mounted terminal plate are coated with special titanium-metallic lacquer paint. The woofer is a newly constructed design, utilizing a specially developed, high-impulse voice coil and powerful hybrid (neodymium/ferrite) magnet system. The goal was to achieve incredibly fast and precise bass reproduction, with intense transient behavior. The design creates a well-controlled linear movement of the voice coil and provides outstanding dynamics and low bass extension, while also reducing distortion. The special tweeter design is incorporating a new, intensely powerful magnet system and advanced chamber tuning. The performance targets have been met, showcasing an improved reproduction of higher tones, outstanding detail and accuracy, amazing dynamics, and a smooth and natural presence; all that will astonish even the most experienced and critical listeners.  Not only is the quality of the drivers used in such a speaker design the key to advanced performance, but the way the are integrated in the loudspeaker. The crossover, as typical of Dynaudio designs, is a phase correct 6 dB per octave design. Although a shallow slope may indicate few components needed, this network incorporates more than 20 individual high-grade components, mounted on two separate boards, in different locations. Only the highest select grade components are used, matched to less than a 1-% tolerance. The two boards, one for the tweeter network and one for the woofer, are physically separated to eliminate the possibility of stray-field magnetic interaction (crosstalk) and other distortion creating effects. In all, the crossover network is engineered at the highest caliber for any available loudspeaker in the size and price class of the Contour 1.3 SE. The Dynaudio Contour 1.3 SE is destined to set a new reference of quality in its class - adding a new dimension to the world of compact monitors, and completes the entire range of Dynaudio loudspeakers.

        "opis": "'If Stradivarius was alive today, his name would probably be Strådivårisen.' \"For more than three centuries, experts have been trying to discover the secret behind some rather good sounding small boxes from Cremona, Italy. For the last decades, some small wooden boxes from Skanderborg, Denmark, have turned out to be just as puzzling!\" Børge Jensen, Dynaudio-engineer for eight years. Yes, a great loudspeaker can be small. For the Contour 1.3, the successor of the legendary Contour 1, the classic small high end speaker, let's start with the drive units: having optimized them for a mere 16 years, we think, they define a new, true state of the art. The tweeter combines elements of our unsurpassed Esotar T -330 D with features from our new Esotec D-260 for a combination of power and musicality which is new in this class. With a Ferrofluid-damped resonance and an aluminium voice coil which we would like to call light as a feather, except it weighs even less. With unlimited dynamics, and a linear frequency response, free from peaks and dips, even above 20 kHz. The further improved bass driver sets new standards especially for the reproduction of low frequencies: With an oversized voice coil, which assures perfect control of even the most minute membrane displacement. With a flat, linear group delay membrane geometry, our famous magnesium polymer membrane material with exactly defined damping characteristics, and a vented center magnet system. And, thanks to a frequency-dependent active surface, with a very homogenous off-axis response and extreme dynamic capabilities. The Contour 1.3's enclosure has been further stiffened at the resonance nodes. Computer-calculated reinforce-ments allow a completely uncolored reproduction of the all-important midrange. The final result is an even-tempered musicality in all frequency ranges and with all kinds of music - even if the signal source is less than perfect; the Contour 1.3 can be run with medium power (and price) amplifiers. Which justifies the not quite so low price of this exceptional compact speaker, as does its sound quality, which far sur-passes what you' d expect in this class and from a speaker this size.

Music isn't a bunch of little dots flashing on your amp, or how many points something scores on some test. You don't hear with your laboratory; you hear with your ears and with your heart. Music - to me - is when after the first bar I'm not in my living room anymore. I'm back at the \"Three Deuces\", \"Minton's\" or one of the other places where they used to play. I remember the times, when musicians were real people, playing every single note themselves. Just as we build every single driver ourselves today. It's too bad that there aren't a whole lot of people who feel that way about things, these days. Maybe that´s because most people can´t even feel the difference anymore.\"  The unbelievable transparency and breath-taking stereo imaging of the sound of a Contour 2 are not the result of a development of spectacular tricks, or pseudo-scientific solutions. They are the result of a comprehensive overall design concept involving every detail - no matter how unimportant it may seem. Two completely separated chambers with different resonance frequencies (computer-designed over several months) provide minimal cabinet vibrations.  The Dynaudio Variovents on the rear allow for the bass response of a loudspeaker four times the size. The voice coils of the woofers were designed larger than usual for complete control of the diaphragm. The liquiddamped tweeter and midrange drivers (in contrast to 90% of all speaker systems they are exclusively designed and constructed by the manufacturer himself, i.e., by us) can handle any pulses with the highest precision - absolutely free of distortion. And owing to a special design feature, the dome of the tweeter is decoupled gradually as the frequency rises, in order to reduce the moved mass. Furthermore, like all models of this series, the Contour 2 features a linearized impedance response and a corrected phase response to exclude diffusivity and sound coloring (after all, music is not a sine signal!). In view of these features, you might take the additional OCOS connection for granted. But we don´t mind. We think it should be (although our competitors might not agree). And this is naturally reflected in the credo of our development team: Progress - yes! But please, in the right direction!

Every single Contour is thoroughly tested after manufacture - and then personally checked, before it's allowed to leave the shop. As chief tester, I guarantee that with my signature - and my ear. As a logical consequence, we build rather few and rather expensive loudspeakers. The few that we do build, however, are worth their weight in gold.\" Big boxes don't necessarily reproduce great music, as Mr. Stradivari made cIear. That's why we believe that it's not the dimensions that make a loudspeaker great, but the composition of all the details. Out of this approach we developed the Contour 1, the classic among small speaker systems. It features a dynamic response so brilliant, you'd think there's a larger speaker hidden inside (but where?!). The astounding low-frequency characteristics are achieved by a woofer driver with a 75 mm voice coil, which was especially designed for this system, and by the Dynaudio Variovent. It features a linearized impedance response and phase-correction circuitry; and, like its larger relatives, it is equipped with a frequency crossover of utmost quality and a slope of only 6 dB/oct. This avoids distorting pulse errors, which inevitably occur in crossovers with a higher slope. On the whole, the Contour 1 was designed with the care and precision necessary for the design of a high-end loudspeaker. That is why it shows measurement values in the lab hardly any competitor can achieve with considerably greater volumes. That is why it offers a degree of reliability and a power handling capacity many other expensive products cannot compete with. And finally, that is why even the pulses coming from the most powerful amplifiers are reproduced completely - without distortions......true to the music......as we stand true to our company motto:Danes don't lie!

Dynaudio develops and produces all cf its drivers in house, incorporating many proprietary technological advances into the designs, allowing for optimised performance synergies. For example, the pole piece utilises a venting hole with aerodynamic properties to avoid reflections and reduce resonance, resulting in a cleaner, undistorted sound. The oversized voice coils are constructed out of pure aluminium, allowing a lighter weight than the typical copper alternative. Due to this lower weight, Dynaudio drivers are much faster than conventional units equipped with copper coils and can faithfully reproduce the complete dynamic range of the audio signal without compression or distortion. The cabinets are hand-built by skilled master-craftsmen using only the finest materials and most exquisite non-endangered natural veneers. Dynaudio developed a special, non-toxid organic glue for use in the cabinets' construction, and all materials adhere to the highest environmental standards. As a result, these speakers will reproduce perfect sound even after many years. When you listen to these speakers for the first time, you will be astonished by the precision, resolution and the realistic sound stage and image - whether enjoying the latest blockbuster movies or listening to your favorite music. Dynaudio has drawn from the experience with its flagship Evidence to reduce the energy lost to the ceiling and the floor, which would otherwise create reflections and colorations. Thus all acoustical information is precise and clear at all positions through the entire listening area.

It should be positioned dose to the screen to reproduce the dialogue as authentically as possible. The Contour T 2.1 can be placed either above or below the video monitor, and is constructed to allow one to be able to place a TV right on top of it, regardless of the weight of the TV. The driver configuration and tuning is exactly the same as that in the Contour T 2.5. The cabinet features inner bracing and multilayered sandwich technology to eliminate cabinet resonance. This ensures that the sound output will be derived only from the drivers and not from the cabinet. Even at the highest output levels, the T2.1 is up to the task, almost without effort. The light-weight aluminium voice coil is cooled by a magnetic fluid, and the heat is transferred to the 4 mm thick metal front of the tweeter, allowing for higher power handling and greater durability. And in keeping with the tradition of Dynaudio's legendary Contour series, the audible performance is equally matched by the high-quality, hand-crafted cabinet finish and meticulous attention to detail. The Contour T 2.1 is magnetic shielded, so it will extremely minimize adverse effects on your video image. The Contour T 2.1 does not add any specific sound or coloration to the information. Everything is reproduced exactly as it has been recorded in the movie or studio, rendering the most realistic, natural and dynamic center channel performance possible. The Contour T 2.1 is intended to be used in combination with any of the high performance Dynaudio Contour loudspeaker systems to create a breathtaking home theatre loudspeaker system; in particular to the elegant Contour T 2.5 and its matching driver configuration.

Designed specifically for mid-sized rooms, this two-way speaker features dual active bass drivers incorporating 75 mm (3 inch) woofer voice coils and long throw progressive spiders for improved membrane control. Our renowned soft dome tweeters are the secret behind the Contour 1.8 MKII's incredible sensitivity and dynamic range. These ferrofluid-cooled and damped tweeters are purposely moulded in one piece to provide the listener a perfectly integrated sound. With a double magnet system on all drivers, and heavy duty cabling for durability and strength, the Contour 1.8 MKII is a floor mounted speaker that is really going places. However, to ensure your speaker stays just where you want it, we're equipping each one with a spiked MDF base. It's the ideal way to keep these little beauties under control!

        "opis": "Listen with Confidence. New materials, techniques and the application of new acoustic theories means ‘great’ just got greater. They stand 1.73m tall. They have two 28m Esotar2 tweeters with our own precision coating. They use two 15cm midrange drivers and two 20cm woofers – all made from our very ownMagnesium Silicate Polymer material. And their ultra-lightweight aluminium voice-coils accompany non-magnetic Kapton formers, high-quality internal wiring and a sophisticated first-order crossover. The C4s produce utterly captivating sound – from incredibly deep, controlled bass to clear, smooth, detailed highs. Much like motor-racing technology ends up in your family car, we’ve taken the expertise we’ve gained from decades of building professional monitors for major recording studios and applied it to home audio. It’s all about compensating for floors and ceilings – which reflect the sound coming from your loudspeakers and introduce distortions and time delays. It’s those effects that colour the sound you hear – and while a splash of colour is lovely on the wall, you don’t want it in your music. We utilisedDynaudio Directivity Control (DDC)in the Confidence Platinum C4 and C2 to minimise those unwanted distortions. The vertical symmetrical driver array and sophisticated crossover are designed to reduce the energy dispersed to floors and ceilings by up to 75%. That means more of it comes directly to you in your seat, and makes the speakers far less dependent on the room they’re in. It isn’t just a driver arrangement, though: every part of the signal chain is optimised for the technology. Each tweeter complements each woofer in frequency response and phase relationship. Each crossover component is precisely selected for the job. And on thefloorstanding speakersin the Confidence Platinum range, we make sure each set of drivers and crossover parts is precisely matched to the other – so they work in tandem.

They use the sameprecision-coated Esotar2 soft-dome tweeter, the samemagnesium silicate polymer (MSP) mid/bass woofer, seen here in a 17cm version, and the same Kapton voice-coil former, advanced first-order crossover, machined aluminium baffle and glass-blasted tweeter plate. And they deliver the same smooth tonal balance, resolution of detail and the feeling of being in the room with the musicians as their larger siblings. We’ve used a high-quality classic first-order crossover filter – and select components – in a special design that achieves sound radiation with a slightly upwards directivity.  The C1 Platinum delivers excellent imaging and soundstaging, while boundary reflections from the floor will be considerably less than with conventional monitor designs.

        "opis": "Cutting-edge acoustic technology meets traditional Dynaudio heritage. The Confidence C2 serves up seamless balance, effortless control and the kind of sound that will keep you glued to your seat. The slimline C2 Platinum adapts our reflection-conquering DDC tech to a more compact floorstanding design. The drivers comprise two 17cm mid/bass drivers, matched to twin 28mm Esotar2 tweeters – all designed to deliver seamless integration, unparalleled staging and a real sense of Being There. Like the C4 Platinum, the C2 features adjustable spikes hidden in the base for fine-tuning their position in your room, while concealed speaker-cable connectors in the back keep everything neat. After all, your eyes should be on the speakers – not the wiring. Much like motor-racing technology ends up in your family car, we’ve taken the expertise we’ve gained from decades of building professional monitors for major recording studios and applied it to home audio. It’s all about compensating for floors and ceilings – which reflect the sound coming from your loudspeakers and introduce distortions and time delays. It’s those effects that colour the sound you hear – and while a splash of colour is lovely on the wall, you don’t want it in your music. We utilisedDynaudio Directivity Control (DDC)in the Confidence Platinum C4 and C2 to minimise those unwanted distortions. The vertical symmetrical driver array and sophisticated crossover are designed to reduce the energy dispersed to floors and ceilings by up to 75%. That means more of it comes directly to you in your seat, and makes the speakers far less dependent on the room they’re in. It isn’t just a driver arrangement, though: every part of the signal chain is optimised for the technology. Each tweeter complements each woofer in frequency response and phase relationship. Each crossover component is precisely selected for the job. And on thefloorstanding speakersin the Confidence Platinum range, we make sure each set of drivers and crossover parts is precisely matched to the other – so they work in tandem. The Confidence Platinum models are available in the finishes established with the Evidence Platinum:     We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "The development of the flagship Dynaudio Evidence range confirmed that integrating the tweeters into a solid aluminium-block housing offered the most ideal performance solution. To achieve a similar level of optimization, the tweeters of the C4, as in all the Confidence models, are integrated into such a moulded aluminium module. This measure prevents vibration and resonance from affecting the tweeters' performance and disturbing the phase response, allowing the Esotar² an extremely rigid enclosure as well as a temperature-ideal environment in which to operate. In view of Dynaudio's DDC technology, it is necessary to utilize a symmetric driver array - including dual tweeters - to cover the entire frequency range. The frequency response of the mirrored-pair drivers is perfectly integrated to yield an ideal dispersion into the room by avoiding ceiling and floor reflections. Imaging is precise, open, and spacious, and the sound is unaffected by room induced colorations or distortions. The response is free of peaks well over 20 kHz, thereby validating that the design is perfectly suitable for all high-resolution, extended frequency range digital formats such as SACD and DVD-Audio. To provide a solid foundation for the speakers' technical capabilities to be fully realized,Dynaudio constructed an intelligently designed base plinth - borrowed from the Evidence concept - in which four individuallyadjustable internal spikes are concealed to facilitate perfect alignment and levelling. The high quality binding post assemblyis also integrated into the base plate, disappearing into the elegant lines of the stable and heavy plinth.

        "opis": "Perfect dialogue reproduction for advanced multi-channel systems at the Dynaudio Confidence level is facilitated through the Confidence Center model. In the Confidence Center, dual Esotar2 tweeters are mounted in the 10 mm thick, anti-resonant aluminium plate integrated into the massive front baffle. In conjunction with the specially tuned crossover, the tweeters offer the benefits of the DDC technology, greatly reducing reflections from the room's floor and ceiling boundaries, yielding a sonic reproduction of the recording that remains true to the original performance. The two mid/woofers are powered by 75 mm diameter aluminium/Kapton® voice coils and highly efficient neodymium magnets, integrated into a rigid, resonance-absorbing low mass aluminium frame. The baffle uses the same construction as the other Confidence models, while the cabinet base features a mechanism that allows the angle of dispersion to be focused upwards or downwards to optimize such with regards to positioning the speaker below or above the video screen. The acoustic phase is further adjusted by a toggle switch to optimize the height of the soundstage in these same positioning scenarios. The level of sound quality remains true to the Confidence name. Due to the Confidence level technology, the Center model provides a solid, tight and dynamic performance, with excellent reproduction of any music of film based material, ensuring you the best seat in the house in amost musical theater, one capable of convincing even the most ambitious cinema enthusiast or movie critic.

        "opis": "With its slim, graceful profile, and its 155 cm height, the Confidence C2 makes a bold statement as the entry floor standing model in the Confidence range. The advanced driver designs are housed in a massive baffle, which seemingly floats in front of the cabinet enclosure, forming a gently curved outline on its precisely moulded proportions. Audibly, perfectly accurate imaging is achieved, as is a soundstage with authentic dimensions, while vocals are rendered with an unbelievably natural precision. In typical Danish fashion, Dynaudio pays meticulous attention to high quality workmanship and extraordinary value. Each Confidence model is built in Denmark, completely in-house, through a combination of advanced computer-aided production engineering and exhaustive hand-craftsmanship. The result is a high-end loudspeaker with a furniture grade cabinet that will endure for decades while always maintaining the beauty of its appearance. The performance of the C2 is further aided by the technical merit of its advanced drivers, the DDC technology and a balanced impedance. Low frequencies are reproduced effortlessly without consequence, and it is possible to utilize even inefficient power amplifiers due to the ease of drive achieved through its linear impedance.

Aesthetically pure yet technically advanced – the C2 II combines a unique slim cabinet with an innovative baffle design. In the Confidence, a completely new design-concept defines the front of the loudspeaker as a design element in its own right.  The multiple-layer high-density baffle yields extremely low-resonance and de-couples the loudspeaker drivers from the cabinet itself. The Confidence Signature models are exclusively available in dark-brown Mocca or dark-red Bordeaux realwood finished with high gloss piano lacquer and proudly feature an aluminium backplate plate adorned with the signature of Dynaudio's founder and sole owner, Wilfried Ehrenholz.

        "opis": "The one for movie lovers: defined, potent, literal. The ideal companion to our upright Contours. The Contour 25C seamlessly integrates for an awesome surround-sound performance. It’s been said that sound accounts for as much as 80 per cent of the moviegoing experience. And we can’t argue with that (musicals, especially, don’t have quite the same impact with the volume set to zero). That’s why we created the Contour 25C centre-channel. Mix and match it with a combination of Contour 20s, 30s and 60s for a seamlessly integrated multichannel system – a system on which you know you’ll be able to enjoy stereo music as much as you will a teeth-rattling blockbuster. Why? Because it’s essentially a Contour 30 turned on its side, with the tweeter moved to the middle.The super-detailed Esotar2 soft-dome unitis flanked bya pair of 18cm MSP drivers– all of which use the same high-end lightweight aluminium voice-coils and magnetic ferrofluid technology as the rest of the Contour range. Our loudspeakers are used in music and movie production studios all over the world – so we know how crucial it is to reproduce multichannel sound to its fullest potential (you should come to Movie Night at Dynaudio HQ. It’s amazing ... but you’ll have to be able to speak Danish). And if you’re investing time in watching a movie (or even a TV show), you want that experience to be as clear, dynamic, assured and powerful as it can be. Most of the speech information comes out of the centre-channel, which is why the Contour 25C’s combination of legendary materials and balanced, neutral sound is so ideal. That’s why the Contour 25C doesn’t compromise. All the knowledge, care and enthusiasm that goes into our upright speakers is here, too. The finish is furniture-grade; the materials top-quality (we’ve even redesigned the baskets that hold the drivers in the cabinets – and yes, we know you can’t see them; we wanted to do it anyway).

No. The Contour 20 standmounter takes everything we know about speaker technology – we’re Danes; we know a lot – and puts it in a compact, clean and great-sounding package. Itssweet-toned Esotar2 soft-dome tweeterhas been a legend in its own right for years. It’s commonly regarded as one of the world’s best-ever drivers – and because it’s been such a great friend to so many millions of ears (and a key part of Contours past), we just had to give it another outing. The extended-excursion 18cm woofer, though, is an original designIt’s powered by a lightweight aluminium voice-coil and a vented dual-ferrite magnet system, and was created by driver specialists Danny Pasfall Christensen and Andreas Eberhardt Sørensen and their team under acoustic maestro Daniel Emonts. (They can hear the differences between different types of glue. We like those guys.) It’s made from MSP– a material we developed ourselves, and have been using in our drivers since 1985. MSP gives exactly the right combination of stiffness and damping – which you’ll hear as exactly the right combination of power, finesse and control. Just what a Contour speaker should have. But we’ve taken it further: we’ve varied the diaphragm’s thickness across its surface, which gives even greater control over its sound. Making a Contour without its signature baffle would be like making a car without wheels. Unthinkable. But there’s always room for improvement – and our designers love to stretch their legs (you should see the number of sketches they produced for just this part).This baffle isaluminium,and set into the cabinet.Its chamfer is included in the driver’s basket – which not only looks great, but also reduces unwanted high-frequency diffraction effects for clearer treble, and provides a solid foundation for the drivers to do their work. A solid foundation means improved high-volume performance at low frequencies, too (although your neighbours might not thank us for that). And although we might have changed the cabinet’s shape(square is out; curves are in), the design tips a respectful nod to older Contours. Look at it from the top; you’ll see the old baffle design in its shape. But it isn’t just for show – the updated shape marries those aesthetics with cutting-edge acoustic physics. Its multi-layered construction is extremely well-damped, which means the Contour’s sound goes exactly where it’s supposed to: forwards. We’ve redesigned the internal wiring and crossover, too.You won’t see what we’ve done, but you’ll hear the effect: amazingly clear sound, even off to the sides of the speakers. We love it.

Mid-size room? Mid-size speaker. Contour 30 steps it up a notch from the 20. Of course, it still treads the same path – one of honesty, transparency and sheer entertainment, but it puts it all in a bigger package. We’ve endowed Contour 30 with two 18cm MSP drivers, as well as doubling up on the rear ports. What makes our drivers so special? Variable thickness across the diaphragm, for one thing. And aluminium voice-coils, for another. We can make them extremely light – but also bigger than the old-style copper units you’ll find elsewhere. Lighter weight means larger diameters, which means we can use more windings, which means we have more control over the cone movement. And that means more control over the sound – especially at high frequencies and high volumes. Sure, we experimented with small voice-coils on the Contour – the size other companies might use. The measurements said they should work for Contour. Our ears said otherwise, so we went big. Our ears were right. And, of course, we’ve includedthe ultra-pure, ultra-clear, ultra-sweet-sounding Esotar2 fabric soft-dome tweeter.You might also notice that we’ve put it back on top of the mid/bass drivers. Never let it be said that we don’t read our fan-mail. And because we’re irrepressible tinkerers, we’ve given the inside a makeover, too. As with the Contour 20 and Contour 60, the Contour ’30 has updated baskets to hold the drivers themselves, as well asan improved crossover and wiring. We listened to our old Contours for months – the whole range (as if we needed an excuse) – and decided we wanted the crossover to serve up even better bass. So now, you can go louder and lower. You’re welcome. While our engineers and designers were hunkered down listening to everything from jazz, to classical, to metal, to electronica, the team in our on-site factory were scouring sustainable sources for high-quality materials and finishes.

        "opis": "The big one: commanding, clear-cut, absolute. If you have a bigger listening room – or if you just like to play it loud – the Contour 60, with its unique midrange driver, is your new best friend. If our designers loved working on the Contour 20 and 30, the Contour 60 was an even bigger ticket for them. It’s a three-way design. At the bottom sit two 23cm MSP woofers (bigger, redesigned brothers of the 18cm drivers we’ve used in the Contour 20 and 30). At the top, like the jewel in the crown of every other speaker in the Contour range, is the magnificent Esotar2 soft-dome tweeter. Between them is a completely updated15cm midrange driver. Like the rest of our drivers it uses an aluminium voice-coil. It also deploys a neodymium magnet system, and was designed using Finite Element Method optimisation techniques. We set Daniel, Danny, Andreas and their guys to work on it because we wanted the Contour 60 to retain that signature midrange sound in a large cabinet, without having to repurpose an existing driver for a job it wasn’t designed for. They did an amazing job. All the drivers are powered by low-mass, high-durability aluminium voice-coils. And the tweeter’s voice-coil sits – as they do across the Contour range – in a special magnetic ferrofluid. It works like a shock absorber and dissipates heat to reduce stress on the moving parts – which improves power-handling, widens the frequency response and ... and now we’re just boasting. What it means for you, in your favourite room, listening to your favourite music, is consistent Contour quality, at neighbour-bothering volumes (if you’re the type), all day. The Contour 60 shares the sameredesigned crossover and componentsas the rest of the range – and, of course, has Allan Kristiansen’s seal of factory approval on the construction and finish (his team will spot even the tiniest defect and spend three weeks refinishing not just one, but both speakers so they’re identical as a pair. They’re really hard to buy office furniture for). The multi-layer curved cabinetand sleek-but-solid aluminium baffle provide your music (which was likely mixed using Dynaudio studio speakers, too) with a robust, defined acoustic foundation. So much so that, if we’ve done our jobs right, you’ll forget they’re even there and just ... listen.

        "opis": "In the Dynaudio Sapphire, twelve distinct surface planes and twenty-four adjoining lines trace the unique design of the loudspeaker. The mid-band frequencies are handled by a dedicated Dynaudio midrange driver which also incorporates Dynaudio’s proprietary MSP cone material and its dispersion-optimized geometry, thus reproducing every note perfectly clear and pure, and completely naturally.To avoid any potential effects from the internal bass drivers’ back-waves, the midrange driver is firmly mounted to the baffle in an acoustically isolated, specially shaped low-resonance cabinet chamber.Delicate high frequency sound waves require a stable and unyielding anti-resonant foundation to be reproduced tonally undistorted and in correct timing and phase.Therefore, the low-resonance, extremely solid Sapphire cabinet, with its internal chamber for the midrange driver and tweeter, provides the ideal setting to integrate an advanced tweeter platform as the Esotar2.All of the Sapphire’s exclusive, high performance drivers are connected and equalized via another Dynaudio speciality: A 1st order crossover comprised of carefully selected, tonally-balanced high-grade components.

'Dynaudio speakers are renowned for their outstanding quality and we wanted to reflect the same innovation and originality in the Facette. The result is a fine aesthetic geometry in complete harmony with high acoustic performance. A delicately tuned and balanced instrument to give pleasure to the eye as well as the ear.'Frederick Rickmann' Most things are either truthful or beautiful. Not a pleasant alternative for the loudspeaker designer. If you give in to the whims of the designer, the result may (occasionally) be pleasing to the eye; trying to listen to music through the resultant concoction it will be disclosed as the travesty such design speakers usually are. Giving free rein to engineers, on the other hand, often leads to speaker shapes even the most dedicated music lover won't want to tolerate in his living room (who feels at home with a coffin?). We at Dynaudio have applied our renowned Danish thoroughness to this apparent dichotomy of aesthetic and acoustic requirements and decided to go back to basics.We initiated a four year research program, combining the talents of our justly renowned industrial designer Frederick Rickmann with those of our equally famous engineers Mark Thorup and Anders Lassen. They came back with a revolutionary design idea: without parallel walls, there can be no standing waves inside the cabinet!  The no less revolutionary result: a loudspeaker as fascinating to the eye of the interior designer as to the ear of the audiophile. A speaker which combines truthful detail of finish with truthful detail in reproduction, and which realizes a true ideal once said to be impossible to reach. Despite all this - or maybe because of all this - it would be a shame just to put the Facette into some Museum of Modern Art. Put it where it can prove its exceptional qualities in everyday use. Every Facette is built according to the principle of non-parallel surfaces: the cabinet panels' influence on sound is almost eliminated. Every part that goes into the Facette is developed and built by ourselves. Every cabinet is created by a master craftsman; you`ll never find a production line on our premises. Every pair of Facette is unique: finished in mirror-image veneers which are never separated during the three months of manufacture.Every Facette is checked 82 times for finish and sound quality: by hand, and with computer programs developed in-house.Every Facette will be listened to before delivery by our legendary chief tester, Sven-Erik Nielsen: nothing but truthful sound will do. We wouldn't want to contradict our company motto: \"Danes don't lie.\" We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "Producing small loudspeakers with extraordinary performance is a Dynaudio tradition. As early as 1984, Dynaudio created two compact loudspeaker systems which attracted favourable attention because of the innovative technology and performance capabiljties offered. These systems became successful and contributed to the subsequent trend toward small, high quality speakers. We have continued in this direction, and the Special One is the result of a research project directed at defining the possibilities of small system performance. We wished to know what could be achieved if drivers, crossover filters, and amplifiers are operated under ideal conditions. We had no limitations or commercial requirements, and every problem could be pursued to its solution.As we became more involved with this investigation, we realized that the results were so interesting that we could not dismantle our prototypes and file away the research for future development, when state of the art reached finally the level of our projections. The decision was made to produce this audiodelicacy for only a few gourmets who could appreciate the experience.   The driver units we decided upon were refined and improved until they exceeded anything we had ever done. When we were sure of their laboratory excellence, we began again matching the drivers to the cabinet requirements. Making our own drivers we are able to interface driver and cabinet instead of during in the crossover with countless components.   For the low frequency range we have used a special version of the 17 W 75. This woofer has a balanced 1:2 ratio between the diameter of the piston and the diameter of the voice coil. In this case the large voice coil allows very high power handling, and, at higher frequencies, the outer surface of the diaphragm is decoupled acoustically from the inner surface, so the mass of the dispersing surface becomes smaller as the frequency rises. The result is weIl balanced dispersion and phase response that makes possible accurate stereo imaging. The controlled phase and amplitude response in the woofer's upper range is a precondition for a seamless crossover to the high frequency driver. Every Facette is built according to the principle of non-parallel surfaces: the cabinet panels' influence on sound is almost eliminated.  Recently Dynaudio introduced the Esotar 330 D high frequency transducer. This unit was the culimination of many years of development, and it has been used in state of the art systems from several manufacturers. This tweeter's capability was taken into account when developing the Special One. Among the many qualities of special usefulness were the excellent pulse response. This is a result of the resonance damping of the swinging system through the use of a special magnetic fluid in the air gap. Ringing in the response is prevented without affecting the dynamic characteristics of the impulse. This system reduces distortion and phase error to very low levels. The most important aspect of the Tweeter drive unit is an ideally vented magnet system that prevents different pressure potentials among the areas of the chambered interior. The chambered rear system allows for a low resonance frequency and is ideally suited for the demanding but sonically superior 6 dB crossover rolloff. Every cabinet is created by a master craftsman; you`ll never find a production line on our premises.  The support material of the dome is made of fine mesh fabric. Before use it is carefully impregnated with a special fluid to give the dome the necessary stability. After mounting the dome and the voice coil in the magnetic system, it is given an additional coating to provide balanced damping and to eliminate resoances. In the lower tweeter frequencies, sound dispersion comes from the entire surface of the dome. But as frequency rises, the top of the dome is decoupled mechanically, and sound dispersion is taken over by the outer areas of the dome surface. This means that moving mass and dispersing surface is reduced. Dispersion and pulse measurements on Dynaudio tweeters conclusively indicate this accurate response. In spite of a trend toward metal domes, Dynaudio has continued to develop the soft dome technology. We know that with metal domes, resonances inherent in the crystal structure of the material create resonances in the response that cannot be avoided. Such resonances are sometimes found above 20.000 Hertz. They are seldom indicated in response tests that are usually terminated before the point of rapidly rising output. These resonances should not be neglected, however. Manufacturers of CD players, for example, are eagerly trying to eliminate small pulse errors around 20 kHz and to filter interference signals at even higher frequencies. They believe that these errors affect the reproduction accuracy.  The Special One crossover is responsible for the distribution of the signals between the woofer and the tweeter. But it must also direct a whole series of modifications of the drive response combination. Large coil and premium polypropylene capacitors are required to carefully filter small rest ripples in the response. The reserves of these premium parts provide a sonic stability and tonal balance on any musical material.  For the last several years Dynaudio has been testing for the best film capacitors. We now think we have a special formulation that is clearly better than all other types. Even in those sections of the circuit which are not in the signal path, this capacitor shows a positive sonic influence. By using these capacitors we have improved the high frequency reproduction; the dynamic resolution is sharper, while tendencies toward \"sharpness\" in sound disappear. The Special One offers ideal conditions: perfect basic properties of the tweeters and perfect electrical response of the capacitors. This combination leads to the detailed reproduction in the tweeter range and stunningly realistic stereo imaging.  Before developing the actual filter, the impedance response of the drivers was smoothed with the help of exactly calculated circuits. This not only influences the optimum functioning of the crossover, but it also enhances the cooperation between amplifier and loudspeaker. Even the tweeter's impedance rise above 15 kHz is audible if the drive unit is precise enough to accurately reproduce these frequencies. Because we take so much care in creating a steady impedance response of the driver combination, the phase correction circuit can respond close to its theoretical potential.   Dynaudio developments are based to a great extent on the application of 6 dB, or first order filters. Often in promotional literature, the impression is given that the use of filters with a high slope, 12 to 24 dB per octave, is a quality feature of loudspeaker systems. This approach has some validity when using drivers of standard construction and a narrow frequency range. Here crossovers with a high slope may help to maintain a smooth frequency response. But on the other hand, the higher the slope of the filter, the worse the pulse response of the drive unit. Since music consists of dynamic signals with many pulses and few pure sine waves, reproduction suffers from filters with a high slope. Therefore, Dynaudio uses only first order filters. Even if this requires highly optimized drive units that are difficult and expensive to manufacture, the musical result shows that it is worth our efforts.   By means of carefully directed structural parameters the phase response of Dynaudio drivers is optimized. The remaining difference around the overlap of woofer and tweeter are balanced by a very sensitive compensation circuit. This circuit uses only high quality components with narrow tolerances and very fast recovery. Long term stability is also a significant factor in the overall design of the compensation circuit. Until recently academic researchers as well as most system manufacturers have discounted the influence of phase on the sound of a loudspeaker system. But from the very beginning, Dynaudio has considered the phase response of a loudspeaker to be just as important as any other aspect, because it has been a known fact that stereo imaging and rear channel information in quadraphony are based to a large extent on differences in phase. A loudspeaker may have an accurate frequency response, but if its phase response is irregular, the consequence will be blurring, exaggerated musical sounds, or harsh tonalities.   Even if all of the aspects discussed above have been carefully observed, the impedance response will still have ripples which can only be controlled by an impedance compensation network. When properly constructed and employed, the impedance response between 100 Hz and 1.000.000 Hz is linear at 4 ohms. The connected amplifier is presented a nearly pure resistive load. The power amplifier can be operated under ideal conditions. Usually a loudspeaker is a difficult load for an amplifier, because complex signal portions generated by the capacitors and inductors require high circuit stability. But in the Dynaudio engineering approach, the loudspeaker system presents the ideal load for the amplifier and the sonic combination is always as good as the potential of the electronics.   Most audio enthusiasts have encountered components that share almost identical structure, design, and performance levels yet exhibit very different sonic properties. It is the fuel that fires the quest for audio excellence. This is a phenomenon that we have often confronted in crossover design. There are several paths that will yield a similar response measurement, but in listening tests the products will have a personal signature that seems out of proportion to the design differences. In the design of the Special One two different technical approaches were followed, and then each was refined for precise measurable fidelity to the original signal. At each step there were extensive listening tests. These tests were performed independently, but as they progressed the two designs began to resemble each other in ways the design team had not foreseen. For example, for the first time ever we used a PC board layout that had no conductor paths. All components are connected directly or with large cable diameters. Inductance coupling of the coils on the copper coating was carefully avoided as well. This was an important experience because we recognized that many results cannot be generalized beyond the immediate experiment. Dynaudio products will continue to be designed experimentally; the designs will be ratified through patient critical listening.   Well designed inductors with large wire diameters can often clearly improve the accuracy of response, During the design of the Speacial One systematic tests with different coil formulation were made. We were able to learn that \"The thicker the wire, the better the results\" was often not the case. We found that the Q (or quality) of the inductor influences the sonic results at high frequency range, is an important contributor to the fidelity of the system. Owing to this experience, Dynaudio developed coils which have several conductors with different diameters in parallel, an advancement we have named CWC coils. Application of these coils makes possible a precise bass reproduction with more dynamic range and less coloration. We believe CWC coils will play an important role in all future Dynaudio products, though they must be part of the original filter design and loudspeaker project in order for the improvement to be maximized.   The Special One sounds like no loudspeaker has in the past. It has no special musical material but allows you to enjoy all music to its fullest potential. It is unobtrusive but intense. For those audio enthusiasts who are looking to improve the chain of high fidelity reproduction, the Special One will certainly stand up to a detailed evaluation; for those who love music the Special One will be a joyful experience.

        "opis": "With the Dynaudio Crafft a monitor has been developed which - at first sight - resembles a lot of other solutions, however, stands out clearly against designed monitors. The Crafft offers a two-way bass reflex design with very compact dimensions. When using a small monitor, it often pecurs that poor low-range and dynamic properties have to be deliberately taken into consideration. This compromise is not necessary in case of the Crafft. The utmost sound quality and outstanding dynamics are achieved, complemented by high reliability and power rating.  For many years now, DYNAUDIO has examined how to guarantee high standards of sound quality in places where only a minimum of space is available. Through our own research and development efforts as well as the entire production of all loudspeaker drivers we have discovered completely new possibilities. More than 12 years of experience in manufacturing high-quality drivers are the basis for the development of the CRAFFT.  The woofer is equipped with a 75-mm-voice coil. This diameter provides optimum drive of the diaphragm and guarantees enough headroom with regard to power rating. The magnet system is especially designed for the computer-optimized bass reflex design of the CRAFFT. The result: bass dynamics and precision hardly imaginable in this class.  The woofer diaphragm is made of self-developed material which is based on polypropylene. These diaphragms manufactured by ourselves are characterized by absence of distortion and a minimum of partial oscillations due to excellent internal damping character of the material. The diaphragm geometry results in a harmonius and uniform pattern. Measurements taken at an angle of 30° or 60° show nearly no difference to on-axis measurements. Especially for studio work this fact is of decisive importance.  The tweeter of the CRAFFT is the ESOTAR T 330 D. This dome-type tweeter was developed for professional application. It reproduces even the finest details with breathtaking authenticity and achieves unimaginable dynamics and power rating. DYNAUDIO has developed a measurement technique which displays the frequency response at various power levels. These measurements show that the tweeter can handle transients up to 2,000 watts without compression.  The ESOTAR T 330 D is manufactured under laboratory conditions. Most of the work processes are made by engineers and technicians. During each phase of production, careful quality checks are made. The com-plete tweeter has to pass a final examination by computer-supported measurements afterwards stored with the serial number. Thus, the properties of each driver can be found out even after years, e. g. if are placement part is required. Tolerance between two tweeters is maximum- 0.5 dB. Provisions are made for tough continuous operation: the heat produced by the voice coil is dissipated to the magnet system with the help of a magnetic cooling liquid. The magnet system is tightly connected with the large front plate which dissipates the heat to the outside and thus acts like a huge heat sink. Temperature influences are often underestimated. But nearly all mechanical parameters of the drivers and therefore the entire sound characteristics depend on the temperature. Furthermore, short peaks with high levels result in a compression effect, due to changes of resistance in the coil which are - again - depending on the temperature. Mechanical damping of the moving system which provides ideal pulse response is another essential feature of this liquid.  The frequency crossover of the CRAFFT is exclusively made from components not changing their characteristics by aging processes. In order to fully exploit the pulse response of the drivers, only first-quality polypropylene capacitors are employed. When developing the drivers, DYNAUDIO takes the crossover circuitry into consideration. This is the only way to adapt all parameters to each other carefully.  The components of the CRAFFT have been developed to ensure that the loudspeaker does not create its individual sound characteristics. Any effects have been avoided. The DYNAUDIO CRAFFT is a monitor that displays the musical events down to the last detail and thus creates objective and impartial starting conditions for a perfect recording. When judging a recording, the listener may concentrate entirely on the recorded music and should not consider the characteristics of the monitor.  The CRAFFT is equipped with two switches enabling the high-range and the mid-range to be adjusted by: ±1.5 dB each. Thus adapting the loudspeaker to room acoustics and to the listener's position.   The CRAFFT offers XLR and banana jacks as well as a special OCOS input.   The cabinet is made of highly compressed MDF boards which - owing to various damping materials and a 'Sandwich' design - suppresses resonances efficiently. The surface is coated with an extremely wear-resistant Nextel finish.early, for longer.

        "opis": "\"Reference Loudspeakers May Come and Go; The Consequence remains\". The privileged position Dynaudio loudspeakers occupy, is confirmed in an impressive way by the Consequence. Following a consistent concept and its realization, it is presented to music lovers who require the best, to aesthetes who possess a sensitive feeling for this uncompromisingly harmonic conversion of quality into a functional design; it is a loudspeaker for the few who are able to fulfil their individual demands and who are willing to do so.  The Consequence by Dynaudio achieves absolute high end. It represents uncompromising technology, and creative innovation on the highest possible level; it possesses qualifications which - together with difficult psycho-acoustical findings - come into full effect at the point that is the final stage for many loudspeakers: the point of truth. Because truth is and will always be the only universally valid standard for the quality of reproduction. The technical specifications are regarded as top quality by any expert. Impressive diagrams, data and curves produced by an oscilloscope, are not the measure of all things, but longlasting, convincing and audible sound reproduction.  We know that the human ear is able to notice even the tiniest sound distortion of modification. It notices imperfections that are often caused by the interaction, i.e. the mutual disturbance of resonances in various parts of the frequency range. The subtle constructive design of the Consequence - the four-chamber enclosure - reliably avoids such problems. On the one hand, the enclosure arrangement provides acoustical resonance decoupling from the floor; on the other hand, it completely prevents interaction of the systems. This is a sophisticated constructional feature that guarantees optimal performance parameters - necessity for an outstandingly demanding loudspeaker.  From the very beginning, Dynaudio has made it a matter of principle to realize integrated concepts. All components are the result of our own research, development, and manufacture. Not only does this include the component loudspeakers with all details but also the fine and noble enclosures, the reinforcement measures, and damping methods. All control processes, attack and decay response, and all interactions of the loudspeaker chassis have been considered in the whole concept. Our loudspeaker systems have established and confirmed Dynaudio's excellent reputation all over the world. And it is our manufacture of loudspeaker systems on our own that led to a certain independence and in many cases to new, often unusual findings. For instance, we integrated into the Consequence, apart from the high-quality tweeter and midrange systems, a woofer with a diameter of 30 cm (twelve inches) equipped with a huge and rapidly reacting 100 mm (four inches) voice coil made completely of aluminium. Having made extensive calculations and extensive hearing tests, we positioned the woofer on top to compensate for the different delay times of the systems: all signals reach the listener's ear at exactly the same point of time which is of decisive influence on the sound homogeneity.  Unconventional research and development, extraordinary constructional efforts and absolutely uncompromising conversion of the findings into \"audio truth\", have made the name of Dynaudio a synonym for strong commitment, for innovative, often revolutionary ideas and research approaches, and finally excellent loudspeaker concepts. The Consequence emphasizes all of these features in a very impressive way. It offers superb stereo imaging, instruments can be exactly located, and the speaker is unobtrusive in a pleasant and agreeable way: it is areal revelation. Most of all, it is the Consequence's complexity that impresses the trade journals and audio purists who consider this loudspeaker a shining example of loudspeaker artistry for the high degree to which the striving for absolute sound reproduction can be put into musical practice. Individual performance features, such as nearly unlimited power handling, pulse fidelity, flat impedance response, linear frequency response, phase- corrected crossover tharacteristics describe details, but cannot convey the Consequence's overall fascination.  The Consequence is and will always be an outstanding experience; it will always be a technical masterpiece that cannot be judged by conventional criteria but sets standards and criteria of its own. The degree of brilliance, dynamic range, bass response, transparency, definition and naturalness realized by this loudspeaker goes beyond the scope of traditional ideas, technology, and functional aesthetics. It is unique, independent, unmistakable, full of character, down to the last detail. It is a loudspeaker which really emphasizes new values, a loudspeaker which is equiped with massive chassis rings, not for the sheer sake of show, but for proven acoustical concepts; it is a matter of course that such a loudspeaker possesses a selected and precious enclosure and first-dass manufactured surfaces. Plainly speaking it integrates best craftmanship and outstanding acoustical properties: quality in the true sense of this word. It is really no wonder that the Consequence has become a masterpiece and, furthermore, a \"collector's prize\" of increasing value.

        "opis": "Dynaudio´s legendary engineering department has designed the Micron to achieve the hitherto unachievable: true high end sound in a wall- or shelf-mountable package. With other small high quality speakers, mounting close to a wall leave the bass bloated and boomy. Not so the Micron. Here, a special, controlled bass loading guarantees a precise and well-integrated reproduction of low frequencies. For the first time, the Micron will allow the most uncompromising aficionados of perfect sound reproduction to hear in small and very small rooms what they really want to hear: The truth, and nothing but the truth.  There are obvious and not-so-obvious elements of beauty. What you ca see is the Micron's classic, timeless Dynaudio design and the enclosure, meticulously hand-made and clad in the finest real wood veneers. If you want to give your thanks to the man responsible, he's our master craftsman Hugo Nielssen. Chief engineer Sven-Erik Nielsen, on the other hand, is responsible for important things you can't see. He guarantees for the famous Dynaudio quality in finish and materials. With his head. And his signature.  As always at Dynaudio, the Micron's bass driver features a very generously dimensioned motor: a 3\" voice coil for a 6\" driver gives perfect control even under the most adverse conditions (even drivers twice this size normally have to do with a voice coil only half as large in diameter). The tweeter shares all features of Dynaudio´s famous Esotar and Esotec series, the accepted yardstick for the industry's most reputed designers. It has been carefully adapted for the Micron's design and can reproduce any program, driven by the best electronics, at the highest quality level.  For the Micron's enclosure, we took great pains (and a lot of money) to achieve two goals: freedom from resonance and inertia. And we did everything possible to man and computer to prevent the cabinet from modulating the music. The result: not least because of the extremely small surfaces, resonances are much, much lower in amplitude than with most larger speaker - the Micron is, finally, a box which will not superimpose ist own echo on the music. The finishing touch is the ingenious mounting method: a single screw and two spikes (provided) safely mount the speaker to the wall and acoustically decouple it at the same time.  We at Dynaudio make less speakers in a year than some other companies in a week. That's the price we pay for our quality standards: every single Micron, for example, has to pass 85 controls during its manufacture, only to be subjected to another two hours of thorough checking by computer an human ears. Which means, we regret to say, that less people get to enjoy truthful sound than we would ideally like. On the other has, maybe there aren't really that many people who truly deserve this privilege. Another reason why you won't find the Micron in just anybody's home.  Most loudspeakers are designed to fit a price point, to help marketability. There are quite enough of those loudspeakers around. With the Micron, we didn't aim for a low price, but for high quality; a wolf in sheep's clothing, a through bred race car among compacts. Physically small this speaker may be, its sound quality will surpass that of most much larger boxes.  Because you like to hear the very best sound, but don't have the space for larger speakers. Because you are spoilt by your high quality stereo system, and can't stand listening to untruthful sound in other living rooms / your workroom / the kitchen anymore. Because you don't want to do without perfect music reproduction when, finally, you really have the time to sit down and listen, in your holiday home or apartment. Because you enjoy excellent sound from what is probably the most technologically advanced, most compact and least obtrusive way of filling a room with music.

        "opis": "The ProjectProducing small loudspeakers with extraordinary performance is a Dynaudio tradition. As early as 1984, Dynaudio created two compact loudspeaker systems which attracted favourable attention because of the innovative technology and performance capabiljties offered. These systems became successful and contributed to the subsequent trend toward small, high quality speakers. We have continued in this direction, and the Special One is the result of a research project directed at defining the possibilities of small system performance. We wished to know what could be achieved if drivers, crossover filters, and amplifiers are operated under ideal conditions. We had no limitations or commercial requirements, and every problem could be pursued to its solution.As we became more involved with this investigation, we realized that the results were so interesting that we could not dismantle our prototypes and file away the research for future development, when state of the art reached finally the level of our projections. The decision was made to produce this audiodelicacy for only a few gourmets who could appreciate the experience.  The driver units we decided upon were refined and improved until they exceeded anything we had ever done. When we were sure of their laboratory excellence, we began again matching the drivers to the cabinet requirements. Making our own drivers we are able to interface driver and cabinet instead of during in the crossover with countless components.  For the low frequency range we have used a special version of the 17 W 75. This woofer has a balanced 1:2 ratio between the diameter of the piston and the diameter of the voice coil. In this case the large voice coil allows very high power handling, and, at higher frequencies, the outer surface of the diaphragm is decoupled acoustically from the inner surface, so the mass of the dispersing surface becomes smaller as the frequency rises. The result is weIl balanced dispersion and phase response that makes possible accurate stereo imaging. The controlled phase and amplitude response in the woofer's upper range is a precondition for a seamless crossover to the high frequency driver. Every Facette is built according to the principle of non-parallel surfaces: the cabinet panels' influence on sound is almost eliminated.  Recently Dynaudio introduced the Esotar 330 D high frequency transducer. This unit was the culimination of many years of development, and it has been used in state of the art systems from several manufacturers. This tweeter's capability was taken into account when developing the Special One. Among the many qualities of special usefulness were the excellent pulse response. This is a result of the resonance damping of the swinging system through the use of a special magnetic fluid in the air gap. Ringing in the response is prevented without affecting the dynamic characteristics of the impulse. This system reduces distortion and phase error to very low levels. The most important aspect of the Tweeter drive unit is an ideally vented magnet system that prevents different pressure potentials among the areas of the chambered interior. The chambered rear system allows for a low resonance frequency and is ideally suited for the demanding but sonically superior 6 dB crossover rolloff.Every cabinet is created by a master craftsman; you`ll never find a production line on our premises. The support material of the dome is made of fine mesh fabric. Before use it is carefully impregnated with a special fluid to give the dome the necessary stability. After mounting the dome and the voice coil in the magnetic system, it is given an additional coating to provide balanced damping and to eliminate resoances. In the lower tweeter frequencies, sound dispersion comes from the entire surface of the dome. But as frequency rises, the top of the dome is decoupled mechanically, and sound dispersion is taken over by the outer areas of the dome surface. This means that moving mass and dispersing surface is reduced. Dispersion and pulse measurements on Dynaudio tweeters conclusively indicate this accurate response. In spite of a trend toward metal domes, Dynaudio has continued to develop the soft dome technology. We know that with metal domes, resonances inherent in the crystal structure of the material create resonances in the response that cannot be avoided. Such resonances are sometimes found above 20.000 Hertz. They are seldom indicated in response tests that are usually terminated before the point of rapidly rising output. These resonances should not be neglected, however. Manufacturers of CD players, for example, are eagerly trying to eliminate small pulse errors around 20 kHz and to filter interference signals at even higher frequencies. They believe that these errors affect the reproduction accuracy.  The Special One crossover is responsible for the distribution of the signals between the woofer and the tweeter. But it must also direct a whole series of modifications of the drive response combination. Large coil and premium polypropylene capacitors are required to carefully filter small rest ripples in the response. The reserves of these premium parts provide a sonic stability and tonal balance on any musical material.  For the last several years Dynaudio has been testing for the best film capacitors. We now think we have a special formulation that is clearly better than all other types. Even in those sections of the circuit which are not in the signal path, this capacitor shows a positive sonic influence. By using these capacitors we have improved the high frequency reproduction; the dynamic resolution is sharper, while tendencies toward \"sharpness\" in sound disappear. The Special One offers ideal conditions: perfect basic properties of the tweeters and perfect electrical response of the capacitors. This combination leads to the detailed reproduction in the tweeter range and stunningly realistic stereo imaging. Before developing the actual filter, the impedance response of the drivers was smoothed with the help of exactly calculated circuits. This not only influences the optimum functioning of the crossover, but it also enhances the cooperation between amplifier and loudspeaker. Even the tweeter's impedance rise above 15 kHz is audible if the drive unit is precise enough to accurately reproduce these frequencies. Because we take so much care in creating a steady impedance response of the driver combination, the phase correction circuit can respond close to its theoretical potential.  Dynaudio developments are based to a great extent on the application of 6 dB, or first order filters. Often in promotional literature, the impression is given that the use of filters with a high slope, 12 to 24 dB per octave, is a quality feature of loudspeaker systems. This approach has some validity when using drivers of standard construction and a narrow frequency range. Here crossovers with a high slope may help to maintain a smooth frequency response. But on the other hand, the higher the slope of the filter, the worse the pulse response of the drive unit. Since music consists of dynamic signals with many pulses and few pure sine waves, reproduction suffers from filters with a high slope. Therefore, Dynaudio uses only first order filters. Even if this requires highly optimized drive units that are difficult and expensive to manufacture, the musical result shows that it is worth our efforts.  By means of carefully directed structural parameters the phase response of Dynaudio drivers is optimized. The remaining difference around the overlap of woofer and tweeter are balanced by a very sensitive compensation circuit. This circuit uses only high quality components with narrow tolerances and very fast recovery. Long term stability is also a significant factor in the overall design of the compensation circuit. Until recently academic researchers as well as most system manufacturers have discounted the influence of phase on the sound of a loudspeaker system. But from the very beginning, Dynaudio has considered the phase response of a loudspeaker to be just as important as any other aspect, because it has been a known fact that stereo imaging and rear channel information in quadraphony are based to a large extent on differences in phase. A loudspeaker may have an accurate frequency response, but if its phase response is irregular, the consequence will be blurring, exaggerated musical sounds, or harsh tonalities.  Even if all of the aspects discussed above have been carefully observed, the impedance response will still have ripples which can only be controlled by an impedance compensation network. When properly constructed and employed, the impedance response between 100 Hz and 1.000.000 Hz is linear at 4 ohms. The connected amplifier is presented a nearly pure resistive load. The power amplifier can be operated under ideal conditions. Usually a loudspeaker is a difficult load for an amplifier, because complex signal portions generated by the capacitors and inductors require high circuit stability. But in the Dynaudio engineering approach, the loudspeaker system presents the ideal load for the amplifier and the sonic combination is always as good as the potential of the electronics.  Most audio enthusiasts have encountered components that share almost identical structure, design, and performance levels yet exhibit very different sonic properties. It is the fuel that fires the quest for audio excellence. This is a phenomenon that we have often confronted in crossover design. There are several paths that will yield a similar response measurement, but in listening tests the products will have a personal signature that seems out of proportion to the design differences. In the design of the Special One two different technical approaches were followed, and then each was refined for precise measurable fidelity to the original signal. At each step there were extensive listening tests. These tests were performed independently, but as they progressed the two designs began to resemble each other in ways the design team had not foreseen. For example, for the first time ever we used a PC board layout that had no conductor paths. All components are connected directly or with large cable diameters. Inductance coupling of the coils on the copper coating was carefully avoided as well. This was an important experience because we recognized that many results cannot be generalized beyond the immediate experiment. Dynaudio products will continue to be designed experimentally; the designs will be ratified through patient critical listening.  Well designed inductors with large wire diameters can often clearly improve the accuracy of response. During the design of the Speacial One systematic tests with different coil formulation were made. We were able to learn that \"The thicker the wire, the better the results\" was often not the case. We found that the Q (or quality) of the inductor influences the sonic results at high frequency range, is an important contributor to the fidelity of the system. Owing to this experience, Dynaudio developed coils which have several conductors with different diameters in parallel, an advancement we have named CWC coils. Application of these coils makes possible a precise bass reproduction with more dynamic range and less coloration. We believe CWC coils will play an important role in all future Dynaudio products, though they must be part of the original filter design and loudspeaker project in order for the improvement to be maximized.  The Special One sounds like no loudspeaker has in the past. It has no special musical material but allows you to enjoy all music to its fullest potential. It is unobtrusive but intense. For those audio enthusiasts who are looking to improve the chain of high fidelity reproduction, the Special One will certainly stand up to a detailed evaluation; for those who love music the Special One will be a joyful experience.

To facilitate the most cost effective solution, only two finishes are offered in the Dynaudio DM series: either Rosewood or Black Ash high-quality laminates. While making the cabinet surface of the DM Center extremely robust and durable, the furniture-grade quality of the laminate provides an elegant, wood-like finish.

        "opis": "An authentic Dynaudio experience. The most compact Emit is ideal for small- to medium-sized rooms or anywhere where space is limited – such as on a bookshelf or sideboard. Don’t go assuming that a compact speaker has small-scale sound. The M10’s 14cm MSP mid/bass driver and 28mm soft-dome tweeter team up with a first-order crossover and a forgiving linear 6 ohm impedance that lets them play nicely with pretty much any amp you plug them into. The tuned bass-reflex port and long-throw driver are optimised for smaller and mid-size rooms, and our designers have made sure they’ll still work shoved up against a wall or on a shelf – because they know not everyone has (or wants) a dedicated listening room. When put to the test against its competition in 2016, the British magazine What Hi-Fi? awarded the M10 with no less than a five-star rating and Test Winner honors.

        "opis": "Die Wahrheit von oben: Vielleicht finden Sie irgendwo auf dieser Welt einen besseren Lautsprecher. Vielleicht auch nicht. Sicher, wir hätten uns mit dem Erfolg unserer Confidence 5 zufrieden geben können, die nach knapp zwei Jahren bereits den Status einer Legende erreicht hat (\"Es klingt, als ob ein Engel die Triebkraft beweist!\"). Aber dieser pragmatische und energische dänische Erfindergeist (\"Können wir das in einem kleineren Gehäuse machen, Erik?\" \"Ja.\") ließ uns trotzdem nicht zur Ruhe kommen. Als Ergebnis gibt es nun einen Lautsprecher, der Musik fast so wahrheitsgetreu wiedergibt wie der beste, den wir (bisher) gebaut haben. Aber auf einer wesentlich kleineren Fläche. Und mit deutlich geringeren Anforderungen an den Verstärker. Wie es große Wahrheiten zu tun pflegen, ist die Confidence 3 diskret über ihre Qualitäten. Wir alle kennen viel, viel größere Lautsprecher (49,5 x 22,5 x 33,5 cm werden nicht einmal einen Zwerg in sehr flachen Schuhen beeindrucken - einer der Gründe, warum die Confidence 3 ihren persönlichen, dedizierten Stand hat). Oder Lautsprecher mit noch mehr Wucht (eingefleischte Heavy-Metal-Fans werden wahrscheinlich ein distanziertes Lächeln aufsetzen - zumindest bis man den Lautstärkeregler ein wenig im Uhrzeigersinn dreht). Aber wenn es um den wahren musikalischen Wert geht, ist das Confidence 3 eine Klasse für sich. Der Hochtöner ist eine spezielle Version unseres zu Recht berühmten Esotar T-330 D, der absolute Brillanz mit ultimativer Musikalität verbindet - ohne das geringste Maß an Härte. (Sie wussten wahrscheinlich, wie er aussieht, ohne es zu merken: die renommiertesten Lautsprecher der Welt neigen dazu, um diesen Hochtöner herum konstruiert zu sein, ein lobenswerter Schritt in die richtige Richtung). Mit seiner ferrofluidgedämpften Resonanz und einer Aluminiumschwingspule, die leichter als eine Feder ist, liegt er nicht nur an der Grenze des technologisch Machbaren. Sie macht auch Schluss mit jeglicher Diffusion und Klangfärbung. Nicht zuletzt deshalb, weil die rückwärts abgestrahlte Energie des Esotar (demokratische 50%) dank der von unseren bekannt zuverlässigen dänischen Ingenieuren auf Hochgeschwindigkeitscomputern berechneten Dämpfungsmaßnahmen fast vollständig absorbiert wird. Das macht die Confidence 3 zu einem der wenigen Lautsprecher, die Sie nicht mit ihrem eigenen Echo ablenken.

How, for example, should a photograph of a truthfully reproduced \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" look? Which colors should our printers use to do justice to the tonal variety of a Debussy prelude?And which graphic artist can catch Mark Knopfler's guitar playing with his crayon? See? That's why you're not holding one of those extra-large, extra-heavy technicolor catalogs which other well known companies (not only in Hi-Fi) have had pasted together for their flagship models by an overpaid ad agency. Instead, we're giving you a small, subtle, black-and-white brochure, to explain as simply, truthfully and honestly as possible wh at makes our new Confidence 5 so special. Without posed photos of musicians who used to be slightly more famous than they are right now. Without grinning endorsements (\"I listen to Yamazuki because they give me money for it!\"). And without those paeans of praise for one's own product that no decent advertisement can do without. (We think it's enough of an event when Dynaudio brings out a new flagship.)

        "opis": "Completely original drivers developed using the highest quality materials led to a breathtaking overall result: the Dynaudio Compound 4. The Compound 4 realized a whole new loudspeaker concept, one based on years of development, extensive laboratory and listening tests and - of course - the innovative Dynaudio Compound system. A slim loudspeaker was born, one that convinced with its unbelievable sound quality and its phenomenal deep bass response, enthusing even the most discerning hi-fi critics: \"...the deep bass is certainly top-notch… the bass impulses are delivered with a fantastic punch and accuracy…\" (Sound, April '86). The advanced performance was made possible by original bass drivers developed in conjunction with the Compound-system: a 2-chamber enclosure in which an inner driver creates the effect of an infinite air space behind the external bass driver while absorbing the bass driver's back-wave energy. Powerful amplifier signals were now reproduced without restriction, the bass was deep, tight and totally accurate with the highest level of precision. The bass driver itself delivered an incredible combination of speed and extension, a combination of attributes only realized through the Dynaudio Compound system.  The Compound 4 utilized a 76 mm soft-dome mid-range equipped with a large diameter voice coil to reproduce the mid-band (500-5,000Hz) frequencies. This driver ensured that signals from the amplifier could be accurately reproduced in their full dynamic range and without any compression or distortion. A 28mm diameter, resonance damped and ferrofluid-cooled soft-dome tweeter guaranteed that even extreme high frequency dynamics exceeding 120dB would be reproduced effortlessly and without distortion. All drivers featured in the Compound 4 were continuously improved until the use of 6 dB-per octave crossovers was possible, thus allowing an optimal impulse- and phase-response to be realized. A further detail implemented into the Compound 4 were the speaker terminals themselves, which featured locking gold binding posts designed for a continuous current of 25 amperes, and delivered a further improved sound quality to the system. The exactly calculated cabinet design and meticulously engineered drivers and select components integrated into the Compound 4 yielded a speaker with incredible performance capabilities. And in the tried and true Dynaudio tradition of quality, any and all superfluous accessories and technical mechanisms which may have added visual interest but did not serve a performance purpose were passed over in favour of true engineering. The Compound 4 was conceived to reproduce music accurately, with authentic fidelity, and set the standard for performance in its class by achieving this goal. Dynaudio consciously abstained from publishing technical specifications as they ultimately do not provide a conclusive indication of the speakers' absolute performance capabilities and overall sound quality. Instead, Dynaudio encouraged that the speakers be experience firsthand - even in the Compound brochure, which itself stated: \"Experience Dynaudio live, you will be thrilled.\" We’re thrilled to announce that two of our products have made the cut at the annual EISA awards in the below categories: • Confidence 20A - EISA Best ...

        "opis": "The Compound 5 loudspeaker featured a bass driver mounted in a separate enclosure positioned atop the main cabinet of the loudspeaker. This arrangement negated many of the problems typically associated with floor-standing loudspeakers. On the strength of carefully adjusted phase response of every single driver unit, there was no need for the listener to be seated exactly in the \"sweet spot\". The optimal listening area was made exceptionally large without any perceptible change in sound quality as the listener changed position. Every technical detail incorporated into Dynaudio loudspeakers has a direct effect on the overall result. Dynaudio perfects these details by developing and exhaustively researching new technologies completely in-house. Every single driver, every crossover-network, and every cabinet is designed according to Dynaudio's extremely high standard of quality. During each phase of the precision-based production, careful quality checks are made, including a final examination by computer-supported measurements.

With a 10\" woofer and 200 Watts of power, and virtually minute dimensions, this sub is tailor-made to take care of even the most comprehensive challenges where space is scarce. Being every bit as versatile as the rest of the BM series, BM9S is a very competent partner for smaller stereo and multichannel setups, giving a very powerful system for even the most demanding users across the globe. The Auto On/Off function, provides a minimized idle energy usage by shutting off after minutes of no input signal. The auto sensing circuit enables BM9S to automatically come to life when input signal is detected. The satellite filters that this sub sports, provides high-pass filtering of the monitor source signal allowing 60Hz or 80Hz corner frequencies. This is a huge advantage for the monitor performance, as the satellites do not need to deal with power consuming lower frequencies.

        "opis": "With a substantial 300 watts of power coming from the 12\" woofer and an impressive low frequency limit of 18 Hz, this subwoofer is the perfect match for the BM and M series monitors. With an auto On/Off function, energy usage shuts off after minutes of no input signal, thereby saving energy when the subwoofer is idle. As soon as an input is detected, the auto sensing circuit enables the subwoofer to come back to life. A satellite filter feature is provided by the BM14S, enabling adjustment of low-pass corner frequencies from 50 to 150Hz of the monitor source signal. The subwoofer will thus take care of the lower and power consuming frequencies, and thereby adding to the performance and clarity of the monitors in the system. This is due to the high-pass filtering feature that the BM14S comes with. If the need arises to daisy-chain more subwoofers to the same system, the low level LFE output gives you exactly that choice.

        "opis": "The BM5A MKII imparts all of the quality and power that you've come to expect from Dynaudio Professional but they have been re-engineered to take nearfield monitoring to new levels of performance. New features include our handmade drivers that offer the best in quality and accuracy. The woofer offers longer excursions so stays linear for longer, resulting in a cleaner, tighter bass response. This louder and more accurate bass is matched at the top end with a high-resolution soft dome tweeter that delivers an unparalleled response. The added waveguide ensures less acoustical reflections and a more accurate sweet spot for the listener, resulting in a much better monitoring experience. We've matched the drivers perfectly to the BM 5A MKII's custom designed dual amps to deliver maximum 117dB SPL while maintaining extraordinary sensitivity, resulting in a louder, cleaner and more accurate sound. The three integrated analog room filters allow you adjustment and compensation of the acoustical monitor placement at both Low, Mid and High frequencies e.g. adjusting for the bass boost at corner or wall placement as well as the potential high frequency console reflections.

Dynaudio didn't use the ubiquitous plastic for the IP24 baffle and frame : CNC-machined from MDF, the baffle provides the perfect resonance-absorbing base for the drivers and crossover, while the frame is made from die-cast aluminium. With the IP 24, Dynaudio offers one of the most advanced and best sounding constructions available in the architectural loudspeaker market. In order to achieve the outstanding Dynaudio performance, the IP 24 employs a large bass/midrange driver whose light cone material is made from Magnesium Silicate Polymer (MSP), its shape geometrically optimized for ideal sound dispersion. The large, yet extremely light voice-coil, in combination with the powerful magnet system, provides precise control and a deep bass response. The specially coated soft-dome tweeter reproduces the treble region and at even very high frequencies or high sound pressure levels it remains free of distortion or the typical edginess of lesser quality tweeters. Additionally, the tweeter level can be adjusted in three steps for ideal adaptation to the room. The crossover, with its select components, ensures a well balanced, homogenous sound. Dynaudio Pre-Construction Brackets are available to better facilitate new construction installations of Dynaudio IP 17 and IP 24 In-wall models, by working both as a template as well as a structural support for the installation. The brackets serve as a guide to the installer in order to help ensure that the loudspeaker cut-out holes are in the desired location upon completion of the building work. Unlike many pre-construction brackets, Dynaudio uses sturdy corrosion-protected metal rather than plastic to achieve a perfect fit.

Just as the larger IP24 model, the mechanical construction of the IP17 is highly sophisticated: An extremely sturdy die-cast aluminum frame with a baffle made from resonance-absorbing MDF and rigid aluminum screw clamps provides a firm foundation for the advanced loudspeaker technology integrated within. The negative impact from unwanted resonances - so typical of the more common light-weight plastic assemblies - is thus effectively eliminated. The cone material for the IP 17 woofer is made from Magnesium Silicate Polymer (MSP). Just as characteristic of Dynaudio is the shape of the cone which has been geometrically optimized for perfect sound dispersion in a room. In combination with the unusually large but extremely light-weight aluminum voice-coil and a very powerful magnet system, the speaker will follow the music signal with great precision. The specially coated soft-dome tweeter remains free of distortion or edginess at even very high frequencies. The sophisticated crossover with its high-grade components and three-way adjustable tweeter level ensures an ideal match with the listening environment.

The IC 17 mid/woofer is equipped with Dynaudio's characteristic MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) 6.5\" cone membrane and 75 mm diameter aluminium voice coil, which combine to ensure the authentic reproduction of even the deepest frequencies. The tweeter is mounted slightly off-center in front of the woofer and reproduces the high frequency range via a 3/4\" diameter specially coated soft dome. The tweeter can be adjusted in two steps via a switch. The directivity characteristics and all other parameters are precisely optimized for the in-ceiling integration. The IC 17 can not only play the role of a visually unobtrusive surround speaker, but also performs admirably as a main speaker, all while delivering the authentic sound quality synonymous with Dynaudio.
